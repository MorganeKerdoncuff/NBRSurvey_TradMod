# ABSTRACT

# INTRODUCTION

- Agriculture has been the main factor of nature transformation since the first forest clearings by fire [@prosch-danielsenPalaeoecologicalInvestigationsReconstruction2000]
- Agriculture has been the main factor of nature transformation that humans have used to ensure their self-subsistence
- Agriculture has transformed nature since the first forest clearings by fire
- Humans have transformed nature since the first forest clearings by fire 
- Since the first forest clearings by fire, humans have used agriculture to transform nature and ensure their self-subsistence

Since the first forest clearings [@prosch-danielsenPalaeoecologicalInvestigationsReconstruction2000] humans have ensured their self-subsistence by transforming nature with a wide range of agricultural practices adapted to the environmental constraints [@ellisLandUseEcological2021; @plieningerTraditionalLanduseNature2006]. To overcome the discrepancy of resources, farmer communities around the world have resorted to remarkably similar strategies based on complementary crop and animal husbandry systems: livestock grazing on low-productive areas provides manure for the edible crops grown on more productive fields, while the crop residues can be recycled as mulch or animal feed [@christiansenInfieldoutfieldSystemsCharacteristics1978; @sekaranRoleIntegratedCroplivestock2021; @yangResearchTrendsCrop2022]. These spatially extensive transfers of energy and nutrients shaped heterogeneous landscapes that have supported a high level of biodiversity and ensured the resilience of the whole agro-ecological system [@altieriLinkingEcologistsTraditional2004; @kremenLandscapesThatWork2018; @tscharntkeOrganicFarmingHarnessing2021]. However these management practices have drastically declined after the Green Revolution, as the introduction of fertiliser and machinery led to the over-intensification of productive lands while remote areas were gradually abandoned [@billenReshapingEuropeanAgrofood2021; @ramankuttyTrendsGlobalAgricultural2018; @reybenayasAbandonmentAgriculturalLand2007; @xieConservationOpportunitiesUncontested2019]. These two concurring trends resulted into an overall homogenisation and degradation of the agricultural landscape, with subsequent loss of the associated biodiversity [@beckmannConventionalLandUse2019; @flynnLossFunctionalDiversity2009; @newboldGlobalEffectsLand2015] and ecosystem functions [@allanLandUseIntensification2015; @isbellNutrientEnrichmentBiodiversity2013] and services [@foleyGlobalConsequencesLand2005; @kwonGlobalEstimatesImpacts2016]. In reaction, the past decades have seen a regained interest towards locally rooted, mixed agricultural systems inherited from the pre-productivist era that would ensure both sustainable land use and socio-economical well-being [@douwevanderploegPeasantriesTwentyfirstCentury2010; @garibaldiFarmingApproachesGreater2017]. 

In Western Norway, the agro-ecological landscape has been safeguarded from severe intensification [@dramstadTenancyNorwegianAgriculture2010; @fjellstadPatternsChangeTwo1999] mainly because of the limiting fjord environment [@ketzlerClimateNorway2021; @nesjeFjordsNorwayComplex2009]. Farmer-fisher communities used to rely on mixed crop-livestock systems, referred as infield-outfield systems [@christiansenInfieldoutfieldSystemsCharacteristics1978], involving transhumance and rotational management to maximise the land use potential from the coast to the mountains [@austadHumaninfluencedVegetationTypes1991; @hjelleHesitantHuntersReview2006; @olssonAgroecosystemsNeolithicTime1991]. Atlantic wet heathland on the flat, notched coastal area would be grazed all year-round and regularly rejuvenated with rotational prescribed burning to improve fodder palatability [@thorvaldsenGammalnorskSauOg2017; @vandvikManagementdrivenEvolutionDomesticated2014]. In mountain areas, subalpine heathlands would be used for sheep and goat summer farming to provide temporary rest for grazing fields in the lowlands [@olssonLandscapeChangePatterns2000; @potthoffChangeMountainSummer2004]. In-between the least productive outfields (*utmark*) [@lillehammerPresentLandscapePerception2007], the large intermediate stretch of more fertile lands would see the development of pluriactive farms encompassing arable lands, grazing fields, hay-meadows and woodlands within a finely grained landscape mosaic of high ecological and cultural values [@haugeGaldaneLaerdalWestern1988; @hetlandPluriactivityStrategyEmployment1986; @olssonAgroecosystemsNeolithicTime1991]. The productivism trend emerging after WWII led to the rationalisation of livestock production, with a shift of grazing animals to fertilised infields (*innmark*) and a subsequent increase of farm size [@dramstadTenancyNorwegianAgriculture2010; @forbordDriversChangeNorwegian2014; @jonesLandtenureLandscapeChange1988]. On the other hand remote outfields were gradually abandoned [@fjellstadPatternsChangeTwo1999; @hamreLandcoverStructuralChanges2007a], causing the joint loss of cultural knowledge and ecological diversity associated with traditional management of hay-meadows [@norderhaugBiotopePatternsAbundance2000; @wehnAdaptiveBiodiversityManagement2018], coastal heathlands [@lundbergAustevollChangingCoastal1991; @webbTraditionalManagementEuropean1998] and mountain summer farms [@noelEffectsAbandonmentAlpine2010; @olssonLandscapeChangePatterns2000; @potthoffChangeMountainSummer2004]. The deep and lasting socio-economic decline of the countryside that followed has made particularly challenging any policy attempt to halt the land abandonment process, let alone reverse it [@blekesauneAgricultureImportanceViability1999; @daugstadAgricultureUpholderCultural2006; @forbordDriversChangeNorwegian2014].

In this context, the nature's contributions to people (NCP) framework offers a useful toolbox for facilitating conservation measures towards less productive areas [@diazAssessingNatureContributions2018]: as a more inclusive update of the ecosystem service framework [@ellisEcosystemServicesNature2019; @haines-youngCommonInternationalClassification2018], it provides 1) quantitative assessments of the direct and indirect benefits driven by the farmers and their management [@bengtssonGrasslandsMoreImportant2019; @bernuesSeeingNorthernEuropean2016], 2) theoretical support for policy-oriented concepts such as multifunctionality [@bjorkhaugMultifunctionalAgriculturePolicy2008; @wilsonWeakStrongMultifunctionality2008] and 3) intuitive methodology for engaging stakeholders and the general public through participatory approaches [@cusensParticipatoryMappingReveals2022]. Examining semi-natural habitats beyond the productivity lenses allows to highlight the values of less fertile areas [@patru-stupariuReviewChangesMountain2020; @walmsleyEnsuringLongtermProvision2021] while identifying the ecological trade-offs generated by different grazing regimes [@geertsemaActionableKnowledgeEcological2016; @germanRelationshipsMultipleAspects2017]. In coastal and subalpine heathlands, slower nutrient cycling process due water saturation and/or cold temperature limit primary production but in return enhance carbon sequestration in the soil [@liLongtermTemporalPatterns2023; @quinCallunaVulgarisdominatedUpland2015]. The very low grazing pressure creates a structurally heterogeneous and colorful landscape highly appreciated for outdoor activities [@tilleyAnthropologyLandscape2017] and maintains a thick and highly functionally diverse bryophyte layer [@austrheimPlantDiversityPatterns2002] that contributes to freshwater supply and regulation [@huStructuralCharacteristicsMoss2023].

The recent designation of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve (NBR) as model area for experimenting and implementing the Sustainable Development Goals in Western Norway [@unescoNewRoadmapMan2017] has supported ecosystem services-based research in both agricultural and non-agricultural habitats [@cusensSocioculturalValuesBiophysical2024; @demeauxJustGrazeIt2024]. In this paper, we focused on the land uses inherited from the infield-outfield system, which is familiar to both policymakers and the general public, to investigate ecological trade-offs along the coast-to-mountain gradient. We first verified whether characterising grazing areas into either infield or outfield was still ecologically relevant through clustering analysis (Q1): as field type reflects both inherent productivity and associated past and current management, we predict it to be the main factor of site aggregation (H1-A). Considering the wide geographical range of our study area, we also expected secondary discrimination between, for instance, coastal and mountain outfields (H1-B).

- Secondly, we tested for trade-offs that should be reflected between field types both aboveground, between primary production and plant functional group diversity (Q2-A), and belowground between soil productivity and carbon sequestration (Q2-B).
- We expected more productive sites to be dominated by more palatable groups such as forbs and monocotyledons and to have higher soil mesofauna abundance, while low-productive sites should be characterised by more stress-tolerant groups such as .

# MATERIAL AND METHODS

## Study area

The Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve (NBR) encompasses in a nutshell the main features of the fjord system in Western Norway [@kalandNordhordlandBiosphereReserve2018]: the sharp elevation gradient creates a tight transition between the mild, oceanic regime on the west and the alpine regime on the east with decreasing temperatures and increasing precipitations [@ketzlerClimateNorway2021]. Between the coast and the mountains, mean annual precipitation can vary up to twice as much (from 1550 to 4800 mm) and mean July temperature can drop by almost half (from 15.9 to 8.3Â°C), along with increasing annual temperature range [@meteorologiskinstituttNorskKlimaservicesenter2023]. The region can thus be coarsely divided into three main ecological zones (adapted from @uttakleivLandskapskartleggingNorge2011): the coastal area, mostly made of flat islets and peninsulas, which have been used for both outfields and infields; the fjord area, characterised by productive infields in the valleys while the sharp slopes are covered by forests; the mountain area, up to 1300 masl, essentially used for summer outfields.

In summer 2019 and 2020. we conducted an ecological survey on 23 grazing fields spread along the whole elevation gradient of the NBR, with 11 infields in the coastal and fjord areas and 12 outfields mainly located in the coastal and mountain areas (@fig-sitemap). The sites were selected according to the Norwegian "areal type" AR5 classification system [@ahlstromAR5Klassifikasjonssystem2019], which defines infields (*innmarksbeite*) as "*agricultural lands that cannot be harvested mechanically* \[with\] *at least 50% of the area* \[...\] *covered with cultured grass or pasture-tolerant herbs*". There is no specific areal category for outfields, but they were located on "open permanent lands" (*Ã¥pen fastmark*) which are described as "*areas that are neither a bog, agricultural, forest or infrastructure*". Information on the sites management were collected from phone interviews with farmers, conducted from October 2021 to January 2022.

Coastal outfields (under 150 masl) were *Calluna vulgaris* dominated heathlands, grazed all year round by rustic sheep breeds such as the Norwegian old sheep (*Gammel Norsk Sau*) or the Cheviot sheep from Scotland (*Sjeviotsau*). Three of them (CO1-3) were still managed with rotational prescribed burning and showed different stages of heath regeneration. The only outfield visited in the fjord area and the resulted from a former forest clearing and was dominated by *Vaccinium myrtillus* and *Galium saxatile*. In the mountain area, outfields were large areas that could be grazed by several sheep flocks from both the rustic breeds and the conventional Norwegian white sheep (*Norsk Kvit Sau*) for at most 4 months during the summer season. Our sites were located between 600 and 875 masl and dominated by ericaceous shrubs (*Vaccinium* spp) with a well-developed bryophyte layer. Infields were permanent grasslands (under 200 masl) dominated by *Agrostis capillaris*-*Poa pratensis* assemblages in the more productive sites and by *Festuca rubra* in less productive areas. In both cases the layer of creeping vegetation was well-represented, with species such as *Galium saxatile* and *Potentilla erecta*. The management was highly variable between farms: the fields were grazed from 3 to 12 months with both rustic and conventional breeds and 7 out of 11 sites were enriched with either artificial fertiliser, manure and/or shell/sand-lime mix.

## Data collection

We visited each field once between mid-June and mid-August according to the "spring" bloom occurring first in the coastal area and in the late season in the mountain area. The sampling area was when possible a 20 x 20 m square, if not a 40 x 10 m stripe, representative of the surrounding vegetation and avoiding rocks, waterlogged ground, trees and field edges. We nested three plots of 3 x 3 m separated by at least 6 m from each other and themselves divided into nine quadrats of 1 m^2^. Five quadrats were dedicated to the non-destructive inventory of plant species and the remaining four quadrats were used for biomass and/or soil sampling (@fig-sampling).

All vascular plants and bryophyte species within each non-destructive quadrat were identified to the species level and attributed a percent of abundance-cover by one of the same two observers (15 replicates per site). When possible, vascular plants were identified with the Nordic flora [@mossbergGyldendalsStoreNordiske2018] on site. Non-identified species, including all bryophytes and lycophytes, were collected and brought to expert identification. Aboveground standing biomass was collected in a 0.5 x 0.5 m^2^ quadrat once per plot (3 replicates per site) by cutting vegetation as close to the ground as possible while avoiding the litter. The samples were stored in the freezer (-20Â°C) before processing. We sorted the standing vegetation into woody, vascular and cryptogams and weighted the dry biomass after 48h in the oven at 65Â°C. We sampled soil with a stainless steel cylindrical core of 200 cm^3^ (diam. 10.5 cm; height 12 cm) in each destructive quadrat and stored it at 9Â°C before lab processing. For each plot, one core out of four (3 replicates per site) was used for Berlese-Tullgren extraction of mesofauna [@tullgrenSehrEinfacherAusleseapparat1918], with aluminium funnels of 62 cm height, 33.5 cm top diameter and 5.3 cm exit diameter. The soil was kept under heating lamps (50 W) for 96 hours on 2 cm mesh size grids at a distance of approximately 40 cm from the bulb to allow the surface to slowly dry. The extracted samples were stored in 70% ethanol for sorting and counting of acari and collembola. The three remaining soil cores were sieved and merged at the plot level (3 replicates per site) for the determination of loss of ignition (LOI) in a certified analysis laboratory.

## Data analysis

All analyses were performed on R (v.4.4.1) with R-Studio (v.2023.12.1+402) [@positteamRStudioIntegratedDevelopment2023; @rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2024], using the *fpc* [@hennigFpcFlexibleProcedures2024] and *mri* [@cugmasMriModifiedRand2019] packages for clustering validation, the *rcompanion* package for effect size statistics [@mangiaficoRcompanionFunctionsSupport2024] and the *ggplot2* package for visualisation [@wickhamGgplot2CreateElegant2024]. All our variables were scaled prior to analysis to account for unit differences.

To check if the observed site distribution reflected the field type classification (H1-A) and/or the geographical area (H1-B), we performed Ward's hierarchical agglomerative clustering on Euclidean-based distance matrix, which minimises within-group dispersion by computing squared dissimilarities [@murtaghWardHierarchicalAgglomerative2014]. We compared the observed primary (first-level branching) and secondary (second-level branching) clusters with the expected clustering according to field type and the combination field type x geographical area respectively using both the more common adjusted Rand index [@gordonClassification1999] and the adjusted Wallace index which is not sensitive to cluster size [@warrensUnderstandingAdjustedRand2022]. The secondary clusters were projected on Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) for visual representation [@minchinEvaluationRelativeRobustness1987].

- For ecological synergies and trade-offs, we first investigated correlations between variables independently of site affiliation using Spearman's rank test [@hollanderNonparametricStatisticalMethods2015].
- We made pairwise comparisons between groups from the same hierarchical division using non-parametric unpaired Mann-Whitney tests [@lehmannNonparametricsStatisticalMethods2006].
- effect size Glass rank biserial correlation coefficient [@kingStatisticalReasoningBehavioral2018]

<!-- and were classified into three categories: 1) diversity, including average species richness of cryptogams (bryophytes and lycophytes), monocotyledons, forbs and woody plants per m^2^; 2) production, including average aboveground biomass of cryptogams, monocotyledons, forbs and woody plants per m^2^; 3) decomposition, including average abundance of collembola and acari per m^2^ and average LOI. -->

# RESULTS

We registered a total of `r totplantsp` plant species, among which `r nrow(totforbsp)` forbs, `r nrow(totmonocsp)` monocotyledons, `r nrow(totbryosp)` bryophytes, including mosses and liverworts, and `r nrow(totwoodysp)` shrubs and woody species. We also collected a total of `r totacari` acari and `r totcollem` collembola across all sites.

## Hierarchical clustering

We obtained two primary clusters (A-B) and four secondary clusters (CL1-4) (@fig-clustertree) which show relatively consistent compactness and separation (see @tbl-clusterquality in SI). Outfields (A) were clearly separated from infields (B) in the first branching (adjusted Rand Index = `r filter(clusterstat, Clustering == "primary")$AdjRandIndex`; adjusted Wallace Index = `r clusterstat$AdjWallaceIndex[1]`), with only two mismatched infields (FI6, CI5) and one mismatched outfield (FO1) (@fig-clustertree). The influence of the geographical area was on the other hand less straightforward (adjusted Rand Index = `r clusterstat$AdjRandIndex[2]`; adjusted Wallace Index = `r clusterstat$AdjWallaceIndex[2]`) as only visible among outfields (CL1 and CL4) which were distinctly less compacted than infields (@fig-clusterord).

## Ecological trade-offs and synergies

Outfields had an average higher soil organic content (mean~DivA~ = `r filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 1)$LOI_mean` &plusmn; sd~DivA~ = `r filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 1)$LOI_sd`; mean~DivB~ = `r filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 2)$LOI_mean` &plusmn; `r filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 2)$LOI_sd`), higher richness of cryptogams (mean~DivA~ = `r filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 1)$div_cryptogams_mean` &plusmn; `r filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 1)$div_cryptogams_sd`; mean~DivB~ = `r filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 2)$div_cryptogams_mean` &plusmn; `r filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 2)$div_cryptogams_sd`) and higher woody biomass (mean~DivA~ = `r filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 1)$biom_woody_mean` &plusmn; `r filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 1)$biom_woody_sd`; mean~DivB~ = `r filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 2)$biom_woody_mean` &plusmn; `r filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 2)$biom_woody_sd`) and species richness (mean~DivA~ = `r filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 1)$div_woody_mean` &plusmn; `r filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 1)$div_woody_sd`; mean~DivB~ = `r filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 2)$div_woody_mean` &plusmn; `r filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 2)$div_woody_sd`). On the other hand, infields had higher forb biomass (mean~DivA~ = `r filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 1)$biom_forbs_mean` &plusmn; `r filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 1)$biom_forbs_sd`; mean~DivB~ = `r filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 2)$biom_forbs_mean` &plusmn; `r filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 2)$biom_forbs_sd`) and species richness (mean~DivA~ = `r filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 1)$div_forbs_mean` &plusmn; `r filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 1)$div_forbs_sd`; mean~DivB~ = `r filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 2)$div_forbs_mean` &plusmn; `r filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 2)$div_forbs_sd`) (@fig-clusterplots A).

Outfields were overall discriminated into mountain (CL4) and coastal (CL1) clusters, but the sites were relatively scattered on the ordination space (@fig-clusterord). Coastal outfields showed on average higher biomass of cryptogams (mean~Cl1~ = `r filter(sheep_summary_sec, cluster_sec == 1)$biom_cryptogams_mean` &plusmn; `r filter(sheep_summary_sec, cluster_sec == 1)$biom_cryptogams_sd`; mean~Cl4~ = `r filter(sheep_summary_sec, cluster_sec == 4)$biom_cryptogams_mean` &plusmn; `r filter(sheep_summary_sec, cluster_sec == 4)$biom_cryptogams_sd`) and woody plants (mean~Cl1~ = `r filter(sheep_summary_sec, cluster_sec == 1)$biom_woody_mean` &plusmn; `r filter(sheep_summary_sec, cluster_sec == 1)$biom_woody_sd`; mean~Cl4~ = `r filter(sheep_summary_sec, cluster_sec == 4)$biom_woody_mean` &plusmn; `r filter(sheep_summary_sec, cluster_sec == 4)$biom_woody_sd`) compared with mountain outfields (@fig-clusterplots B). On the other hand, infield clusters were more compact and did not show any geographical patterns (@fig-clusterord). The only factor distinguishing the three sites of CL3 from the other infields was the abundance of acari, which was distinctly higher (mean~Cl2~ = `r filter(sheep_summary_sec, cluster_sec == 1)$ab_acari_mean` &plusmn; `r filter(sheep_summary_sec, cluster_sec == 2)$ab_acari_sd`; mean~Cl4~ = `r filter(sheep_summary_sec, cluster_sec == 3)$ab_acari_mean` &plusmn; `r filter(sheep_summary_sec, cluster_sec == 3)$ab_acari_sd`) (@fig-clusterplots C).

# DISCUSSION

- The primary aggregation of grazing fields mostly matched with the Norwegian land cover classification (H1-A), with substantially higher between-site dispersion for outfields compared with infields.
- The influence of geographical location partially showed through the secondary aggregation of outfields, but was completely absent for infields (H1-B).
- As expected, higher productivity and fodder production potential was associated with lower plant diversity (H2-A), which was closely correlated with cryptogam and woody species richness, except for forbs
- Finally carbon sequestration was clearly more efficient in outfields compared with infields, but it was not inversely related to the abundance of soil mesofauna (H2-B).


## Understanding the productivity-diversity trade-off in the current NBR farming system

Even if the "traditional" outfield-infield system of Western Norway mostly belongs to the past, the resulting land type dichotomy was durably imprinted in the fjord agro-ecological landscape and still reflects rather accurately current ecological trade-offs, starting with the productivity-diversity relationship. In more productive grasslands, plant-plant interactions are dominated by first strong light competition [@grimeCompetitiveExclusionHerbaceous1973], and second higher grazing and trampling pressures [@buzhdyganDirectIndirectEffects2020], which both combined tend to the dominance of fast-growing and short-lived species [@gaujourFactorsProcessesAffecting2012; @koernerChangeDominanceDetermines2018; @pakemanConsistencyPlantSpecies2004]. Soil enrichment not only exacerbates this competitive process [@conradiResourceAvailabilityDetermines2017] but also adds another selective pressure by lowering soil pH and consequently increasing the concentration of toxic compounds such as ammonium and ionic aluminium [@brittoNH4ToxicityHigher2002; @kochianCellularMechanismsAluminum1995]. Bryophytes and rare vascular species are particularly sensitive to the application of mineral fertilisers [@kiddImpacts120Years2017; @kleijnSearchKeyBiogeochemical2008], and even if manure was reported to be less impactful [@caiIntensifiedSoilAcidification2015; @xuModelbasedOptimalManagement2023] it mostly depends on the applied amount [@koningerManureManagementSoil2021]. On the other hand, low-intensity grazing in nutrient-poor heathland habitats locally overcomes the light competition driven by shrubs [@koernerChangeDominanceDetermines2018; @olffEffectsHerbivoresGrassland1998] and creates patch-like structural heterogeneity [@parsonsSpatialHeterogeneityGrazing2003; @tonnGrazingInducedPatchiness2019] that favour cryptogams, which are the main driver of diversity in the sub-alpine environment [@aldayEffectsLongtermRemoval2021; @milliganWinnersLosersLongterm2016].

- Even if cryptogam is a good indicator of multidiversity [@manningGrasslandManagementIntensification2015]

- Beyond fundamental community assembly processes that could explain the difference in diversity driven by cryptogams, infields 
- If the difference in species richness between infields and outfields could thus be explained solely by fundamental community assembly processes, the relative homogeneity among infields still questions whether the intensification of land use, even if only up to a moderate range, has impoverished the overall diversity of semi-natural grasslands in the NBR [@beckmannConventionalLandUse2019; @lezamaVariationGrazinginducedVegetation2014].
- in Western Norway, low carrying capacity of grasslands (under 5 animals per km^2^/y) that would be overstocked with stocking densities which are considered "moderate" in more productive southern regions [@piipponenGlobalTrendsGrassland2022]
- For instance, the clear distinction between oceanic and boreal meadows that was reported by @losvikHayMeadowCommunities1993 30 years ago was nowhere to be found not only in our analysis but also in other recent studies led in the NBR [@demeauxJustGrazeIt2024 + NBRgradient].
- Even if infields were not distributed across such a large environmental gradient as outfields, a stronger between-site disparity should be expected from the inherent heterogeneity of the agro-ecological system [@steinEnvironmentalHeterogeneityUniversal2014], showing through the wide extent of topographical conditions, including well-drained slopes and flat, well-irrigated areas [@fynnManagingBrowsingGrazing2019; @hesterForagingBehaviourSheep1999], or the highly variable grazing periodicity, ranging from 2 months to all year round [@ravettoenriBiodiversityfriendlyRotationalGrazing2017].

- Semi-natural meadows in the NBR can be still considered as species-rich habitats, particularly with a high diversity of forbs which cannot be reached in less productive habitats, but the convergence may threaten their long-term resilience 

- The negative effect of increasing sheep grazing intensity on species richness is not as consistent in the literature [@scohierHowSheepAffect2012], and we still observed significant forb species richness
- However the effect of increasing grazing intensity on community divergence for *Agrostis-Festuca* communities is not consistent across the literature: either increase [@pakemanLongTermImpacts2019] or slow process/marginal difference [@marriottLongtermImpactsExtensive2009]
- not to the point of very intensive grassland, but still negative in comparison with former habitats [@norderhaugBiotopePatternsAbundance2000]
- Increasing grazing intensity would decrease heterogeneity, especially on steep areas [@dorroughPlantNeighbourhoodLandscape2007]

- On the other hand, the high disparity between outfields suggests that current management strategies are mostly adapted to local conditions and maintain the ecological state [@speedResponsePlantDiversity2013].
- Such heterogeneity is also emphasized by other practices complementary to grazing such as rotational prescribed burning, that creates a both temporally and spatially dynamic mosaic of different heath regeneration stages [@mallikRegenerationHeathlandPlants1983; @vandvikManagingHeterogeneityImportance2005].
- But careful intensification/abandonment -> even more sensitive [@austrheimPlantSpeciesDiversity2001]


- different grazing capacities depending on the habitat type as it is limited by available biomass in nutrient-rich habitats and by nutrient content in nutrient-poor habitats [@gilhausSeasonalVariationsFodder2016]
- stability of aboveground biomass production in Tibetan alpine meadows correlated with high-palatability herbage stability, which AGB is stimulated by rotational grazing against exclusion, & asynchrony between high & low palatability [@liRotationalGrazingPromotes2020] -> importance of maintaining grazing in upland systems
- [check @austrheimPlantSpeciesDiversity2001 & @liangGrazingInducedBiodiversity2021]


<!-- This process is particularly aggravating in Norway where the soil pH is already the lowest in Europe because of the predominance of acid crystalline rocks and colder climate [@fabianGEMASSpatialDistribution2014; @norgesgeologiskeundersokelseNasjonalBerggrunnsdatabase2023]. -->

- discrimination according to geographical area not so sharp, but maybe explained by heath stage
- coastal: higher cryptogam biomass (positively correlated with woody biomass) & woody diversity + consistently low monocotyledon biomass -> older heath stage
- coastal outfield in the mountain outfield group (HopÃ¸yna) is most recently burnt site 
- need more comparison between mountain & coastal outfields


## Belowground

### Carbon sequestration

- As expected, heathland habitats offered better carbon sequestration potential than grassland habitats [@quinCallunaVulgarisdominatedUpland2015].
- The rate of litter decomposition depends on temperature, moisture and characteristics of the litter [@hobbieControlsCarbonStorage2000].
- slower in cold environment
- slower with woody & mosses species
- bryophyte with lowest decomposition rate compared with vascular, and amongst bryophyte *Sphagnum* and *Racomitrium* species with lowest decomposition rate [@langExperimentalComparisonChemical2009]
- slower in saturated environment
- Two infields in the outfield group associated because of their high LOI: on one hand a field very close to the underground water table that flood easily after precipitation, and one field being probably a former forest opening (but we unfortunately do not have more information as the farmer did not participate to the interview)

- young *Calluna* communities (4-15y) carbon sinks while other stages sources [@liLongtermTemporalPatterns2023]
- grassland encroachement on mineral soil decreases C sequestration potential [@poeplauTemporalDynamicsSoil2011]
- Calluna plant communities better carbon sinks than grass-dominated communities in upland because of higher total respiration for grass-dominated [@quinCallunaVulgarisdominatedUpland2015]
- impact of sheep grazing on carbon stocks in nutrient-poor sub-alpine habitat limited if low intensity, but can lead to stock depletion with too many sheep density [@martinsenCarbonStorageLowalpine2011]

### Nutrient cycling

- no trend according to field type or to environmental factors
- Acari group
- highest abundance across all fields FI4 (IS3 - Eikemo) - CI1 (OS2 - Morken) - FI1 (IV1 - Hopsdal) -> nothing to compare (and it shows as sites are quite far from each other)
- sampling bias ? Collembola abundance also relatively high
- mesofauna activity/sampling limitation & challenges

- On one hand more mesofauna expected in more fertile and less stressed soils, but on the other hand negative effect of artificial fertilisation

- Collembola density fertilised > unfertilised [@scohierHowSheepAffect2012]
- overall negative effect of artificial N fertilisation on soil fauna community [@degraaffEffectsAgriculturalIntensification2019]
- dominance shifted from Acari to Collembola with elevation (780-2480 masl) across mixed habitats [@jiangCompositionSpatialDistribution2015]
- different effects fertilisers on soil microbial community @leechComparativeEffectAlternative2019
- direct increase species richness with elevation, but indirect negative effect through decrease soil pH & subsequent decrease earthworms biomass [@buzhdyganDirectIndirectEffects2020]
- collembola abundance as good proxy of soil mesofauna feeding activity [@birkhoferSoilFaunaFeeding2011]
- legume & grass species richness enhance mesofauna feeding activity independently of management or regional conditions [@birkhoferSoilFaunaFeeding2011]



## Conservation perspectives

### Infields

- Overall richness higher in low-intensity farming compared to high-intensity farming [@gonthierBiodiversityConservationAgriculture2014]
- correlation patches with high richness typical semi-natural grassland species, remnant semi-natural grassland patches & man-made structure with long continuity -> restoration former grassland favour both ecological and cultural values [@hamrePlantSpeciesRichness2010]
- Productivity can be stable or decline under more intensive sheep grazing, while extensive sheep grazing did not increase the proportion of undesirable species such as Cirsium, Juncus, Rumex [@marriottLongtermImpactsExtensive2009]
- effect of grazing intensity on grass, forb & shrub production depends on temperature & precipitation during growing season, but overall light to moderate grazing intensity maximise forage production [@pattonEffectsGrazingIntensity2007]


### Outfields

- positive effect of grazing on low-productive habitat diversity and productivity [@koernerChangeDominanceDetermines2018]
- maintaining grazing in upland areas would ensure plant community stability & preservation plant species richness over time [@speedResponsePlantDiversity2013]
- heaths in uplands very important for biodiversity conservation - carabid species [@eyreRelationshipBritishGround2003]
- in upland areas, overall decrease in species richness over time for both grazed and ungrazed treatments, usually associated with decrease of cryptogam species [@aldayEffectsLongtermRemoval2021]
- biodiversity impoverishment in upland areas mostly regarding abundance of lichens and liverworts despite change in management practices [@milliganWinnersLosersLongterm2016]
- effect bryophyte cover on alpine microclimate @jaroszynskaBryophytesDominatePlant2023


## Study limitations

- biomass in itself not perfect proxy of nutritive feeding for animals, as chemical composition & plant strategy also affected by climatic gradient -> more defence mechanisms, thus less efficient energy & nutrient uptake under high precipitations conditions [@hopcraftHerbivoresResourcesRisks2010]
- trade-off grazing intensity with forage quality & animal performance in upland (420 masl) meadows [@pavluEffectContinuousGrazing2006]

- time window very small, and potentially not able to capture processes of either biomass production, where rate over year more appropriate than static measurement [@brownImportanceScaleEvaluating1989], and soil fauna activity [**ref from soil course**]
- effect of grazing intensity on biomass production & interaction with temperature & precipitations varied according to time of sampling within grazing season [@pattonEffectsGrazingIntensity2007] -> we did not have control of the timing when the animals where put into the field

## Perspectives

- trade-off - increase grazing intensity does not always increase productivity, as light & moderate grazing usually maximise fodder production [@pattonEffectsGrazingIntensity2007]
- small-scale farming more likely to have sharper shifts along the multifunctionality gradient due to a narrower range of opportunities, while transition has more chance to be more gradual on large capitalised farms [@wilsonWeakStrongMultifunctionality2008]
- positive relationship between biodiversity and multifunctionality up to a certain level of redundancy which potentially varies according to local conditions [@hectorBiodiversityEcosystemMultifunctionality2007]
- challenge to preserve habitat quality and diversity in areas where farming/management is not anymore economically viable [@kohlerChangesSpeciesComposition2005]
- purpose of rotation & transhumance: to optimise the use of habitats of different productivity, with digestibility & nutrient highest earlier (spring & summer) in nutrient-rich habitats and later (summer & fall) in nutrient-poor habitats [@gilhausSeasonalVariationsFodder2016]
- infield-outfield strategy regaining popularity for control over the N cycle in agriculture by limiting import and leakages [@billenReshapingEuropeanAgrofood2021]

# CONCLUSION

TAKE-HOME: field type relatively robust appreciation of ES trade-offs, even if locally exceptional sites & outfield management offers higher ecological heterogeneity
