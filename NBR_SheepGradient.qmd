# ABSTRACT

# INTRODUCTION

Agriculture has been the major driver of anthropogenic transformation of nature since the first forest clearings by fire [**ref**], and still represents the most extensive and impactful land use globally [@foleyGlobalConsequencesLand2005; @haberlQuantifyingMappingHuman2007; @ramankuttyFarmingPlanetGeographic2008]. To secure first and foremost household self-subsistence and livelihood, farmer communities have diversified their practices accordingly to local environments [@bignalLowIntensityFarmingSystems1996; + non EU]. As such, infield-outfield systems developed in many different parts of the world to overcome strong heterogeneity in habitat productivity [@christiansenInfieldoutfieldSystemsCharacteristics1978; @liAgroecologicalFarmingSystems2001]. This strategy pairs more intensively used and productive infields, usually for edible crops, with extensively managed low-productive outfields, by for example livestock grazing or hay-making, by improving the former with manure and/or hay sourced from the latter. Infield-outfield systems not only created semi-natural habitats of high conservation interests, such as heathlands, hay-meadows, *South examples* [@haladaWhichHabitatsEuropean2011; + South], but also contributed, along with other so-called "traditional" farming practices,to shape mosaic-like agro-ecological landscapes with strong cultural values [@altieriLinkingEcologistsTraditional2004; @vosTrendsEuropeanCultural1999; + non European]. However, transformation of agriculture following the Green Revolution initiated two opposing trends on both ends of the productivity spectrum, with on one hand the introduction of fertiliser and machinery leading to over-intensification of productive lands [**ref**], and on the other the gradual abandonment of more remote, less productive areas [**ref**], which could even be justified for conservation or "rewilding" purposes [@middletonRediscoveringTraditionalVegetation2013]. It has resulted into dramatic loss of biodiversity [@beckmannConventionalLandUse2019; @flynnLossFunctionalDiversity2009; @kleijnRelationshipFarmlandBiodiversity2009; @newboldGlobalEffectsLand2015], homogenisation and simplification of agricultural landscapes [@jongmanHomogenisationFragmentationEuropean2002; + other global], and subsequent exhaustion of associated ecosystem functions and services [@foleyGlobalConsequencesLand2005; + other].

Amongst European agro-ecological systems, the Norwegian westerly fjords stand as one of the most well-preserved [@dramstadTenancyNorwegianAgriculture2010; @fjellstadPatternsChangeTwo1999]. The fjord system, characterised by strong climatic and topographic gradients, constrained original farmer-fisher communities to rely on pluriactivity, rotational farming and infield-outfield management, shaping the whole landscape from coast to mountains as a self-sustained system [@austadHumaninfluencedVegetationTypes1991; @hjelleHesitantHuntersReview2006a; @olssonAgroecosystemsNeolithicTime1991]. Atlantic wet heathland on the flat, notched coastal area would be regularly rejuvenated with rotational prescribed burning to provide more palatable fodder for year-round grazing animals [@vandvikManagementdrivenEvolutionDomesticated2014], and heath also used to be scythed for both hay and domestic use [@lundbergAustevollChangingCoastal1991]. In mountain areas, subalpine heathlands have been used for sheep and goat summer farming, not only allowing temporary rest for grazing fields in the lowlands but also providing direct incomes through cheese production [**ref**]. In-between remote and low-productive coastal and upland stretches, hilly fjord areas offered potential for the development of small, multifunctional farms, encompassing for instance arable lands, grazing fields, hay-meadows and woodlands, and thus shaping the agricultural landscape into a finely grained mosaic of high ecological interest [@wehnAdaptiveBiodiversityManagement2018; also Austrheim]. As a key feature of traditional farming in Western Norway, livestock has connected the fjord lowlands to the coast and the mountains through systemic transhumance and rotational management [**ref**]. If agricultural transition has not been as drastic in Western Norway compared with Europe, or even with the rest of the country [**ref**], farming practices have still evolved for the past 50 years to meet market demand. Livestock production was rationalised by shifting grazing animals to fertilised infields and by increasing farm sizes [@dramstadTenancyNorwegianAgriculture2010; @forbordDriversChangeNorwegian2014; @jonesLandtenureLandscapeChange1988]. If natural constraints prevented intensive grazing in the productive lowlands, the socio-economic transformation of rural areas led to the gradual abandonment of less productive lands, starting with the more remote and isolated areas [@fjellstadPatternsChangeTwo1999; @hamreLandcoverStructuralChanges2007a]. Despite relatively strong engagement from the Norwegian government to preserve agricultural landscape and farmer communities, reversing this latter trend appears challenging as ecological and economic interests are conflicting [@blekesauneAgricultureImportanceViability1999; @daugstadAgricultureUpholderCultural2006; @forbordDriversChangeNorwegian2014].


## Approach

- ecosystem service framework pertinent to use for future trans-disciplinary initiatives and/or policy-making
- understanding ES trade-offs & synergies as necessary prerequisite for sustainable food production @geertsemaActionableKnowledgeEcological2016
- particularly in stressed environments, trade-offs could be expected between short-term plant digestibility and long-term preservation of nutrient pools in the soil [@niuTradeoffsForageQuality2016]
- existing trade-offs between productivity and services & biodiversity, but evidence for lowering in favour to dominant synergies if context-specific and bottom-up approaches @germanRelationshipsMultipleAspects2017
- trade-off milk production & ecological diversity in mountains [@farruggiaAnimalPerformancesPasture2014]
- but assessing ecosystem services requires a good understanding of the functioning of the system
- particularly in the case of grazing systems, revolving around the nutrient and energy cycle created by livestock [ref concept cycle figure?]
- [chunk description different steps & factors of influence]
- as grazing effects interact with environmental gradient [@fynnManagingBrowsingGrazing2019] and habitat productivity [@mcnaughtonEcosystemlevelPatternsPrimary1989], it would be interesting to explore the balance between these different functions according to field types and across the fjord gradient [if secondary analysis relying on temp/precipitation gradient]
- Reference study which looked at plant functional type diversity (alpha, beta, gamma) across elevational gradient in Western Norway [@austrheimPlantDiversityPatterns2002].

- herbivore effect on plant species richness depends on site productivity -> (+) high vs (-) low [@bakkerHerbivoreImpactGrassland2006]
- grazing x productivity [@pakemanConsistencyPlantSpecies2004]

## AIM/HYP

<!-- - In Western Norway, the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve showcases in a nutshell the socio-ecological features and historical trends of a -->
<!-- - The recently designated NBR would be a helpful lever to engage different parties into dialogue and solutioning -->
<!-- - Expand scientific knowledge on these habitat dynamic would therefore be helpful in that regard -->

- Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve = Western Norway in a nutshell + optimal framework to levering decision-making
- We relied on the following triptych: diversity, production, soil nutrient recycling
- We expect the fields to aggregate according to two main subgroups representing infields and outfields respectively, and we expect a form of complementarity between these two groups. 
- The main factor of difference should be woody biomass, which should be dominant in outfields and negligible in infields.
- Outfields are also expected to have a higher bryophyte diversity but a lower forb diversity.
- Infields should have higher monocotyledon biomass and faster energy cycle, thus a lower carbon stock in the soil.
- However we expect these two groups to be heterogeneous due to the diversity of both ecological context and farming practices, and these lower divisions are what we are most interested about.
- For outfields particularly, elevation, proximity to sea and traditional prescribed burning could heavily influence the results.

# MATERIAL AND METHODS

## Study area

The UNESCO Nordhordland Biosphere Reserve (NBR) stretches up to 100 km from the North Sea through the fjord system of Western Norway [@kalandNordhordlandBiopshereReserve2018]. The fjord geomorphology, which grows from flat coastal areas towards sharp mountain slopes inland, creates a tight oceanic-subalpine climatic gradient from west to east with decreasing temperatures and increasing precipitations [@ketzlerClimateNorway2021]. Thus, between the coast and the tallest mountains, mean annual precipitation can vary more than twice as much (from 1550 to 4800 mm) and mean July temperature can drop by almost half (from 15.9 to 8.3°C), along with increasing annual temperature range [**norsk klimaservicesenter**].

In summer 2019 and 2020, we conducted an ecological survey on 23 sheep-grazed fields across the coast-mountain gradient of the NBR, among which 12 outfields, with 6 in the lowlands and 6 in the uplands, and 11 infields (@fig-sitemap). At low elevation, outfields were *Calluna vulgaris* dominated heathlands grazed all year round by rustic sheep breeds such as the Norwegian old sheep (*Gammel Norsk Sau*) or the Cheviot sheep from Scotland (*Sjeviotsau*). Three outfields, located along the coast, were still managed in the traditional manner of rotational prescribed burning to rejuvenate the heath and provide more palatable fodder for the animals. In the mountains, outfields were located above the tree line and dominated by ericaceous shrubs, particularly *Vaccinium* spp. with a bryophyte or graminoid understorey. They would be grazed only during the summer season, by rustic breeds but also by the conventional Norwegian white sheep (*Norsk Kvit Sau*). Infields were permanent grasslands, managed by small-scale rotational grazing of various sheep breeds and fertilised at least occasionally.

Information on field management were collected from phone interviews with farmers, conducted from October 2021 to January 2022. Detailed data are presented in Supplementary information.

## Data collection

We visited each field once following the seasonal lag induced by the fjord gradient, from mid-June for the coastal area to mid-August for the mountain area. On each site, we set three plots of 3 x 3 m^2^ at least 6 m apart from each other within a representative sampling area of 400 m^2^. Plots were divided into nine quadrats of 1 m^2^, five of them for plant species inventory and the remaining four for soil and biomass sampling. 

All vascular plants and bryophytes species within each quadrat were identified to the species level and attributed a percent of abundance-cover [**ref**] by one of the same two observers (MK or AEE). When possible, vascular plants were identified with the Nordic flora [@mossbergGyldendalsStoreNordiske2018] on site. Non-identified species, including all bryophytes, were collected and preserved for expert identification. Species richness was estimated for each plant functional group, namely woody, vascular and cryptogams, at the scale of the site by integrating all species collected across the 15 quadrats.

Aboveground standing biomass was collected from one 0.5 x 0.5 m^2^ quadrat per plot (3 replicates per site) by cutting vegetation as close to the ground as possible while avoiding the litter. The samples were stored in the freezer (-20°C) before sorting into functional groups, namely woody, vascular and cryptogams. We then dried the sorted samples in the oven at 65°C for 48h and weighted the dry biomass.

We sampled soil with a stainless steel cylindrical core of 200 cm^3^ (diam. 10.5 cm; height 12 cm), which was dug into the ground by rotational movements. Samples were stored in the cooler (9°C) before lab processing. For each plot, one core out of four (3 replicates per site) was used for mesofauna extraction with the Berlese-Tullgren method [**ref**]. We spread the soil over a grid of **mesh size** in an aluminium funnel with a cylindrical upper half of 20.5 cm height and 33.5 cm diameter, and a conical lower half of 41.5 cm height with an exit of 5.3 cm diameter. The funnels were kept under heating lamps (50 W) for 96 hours, with a distance of approx. 20 cm between the bulbs and the top of the funnels to avoid too fast drying of the soil surface which would trap the mesofauna. Samples were collected in 70% ethanol for later sorting and counting of acari and collembola. The three remaining cores per plot were sieved and merged (3 replicates per site), and 0.5 L sample was sent to a certified analysis laboratory to determine loss of ignition as a proxy for soil organic carbon content.

## Data analysis

All statistical and ordination analyses were performed on R (v.4.3.0) with R-Studio (v.2023.03.1+446) [@rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2023]. We used the *vegan* package [@oksanenVeganCommunityEcology2022] for clustering projection on ordination space. All data except plant species richness were summarized at the site level by average.

All our variables were scaled prior to analysis to account for unit differences. We performed hierarchical clustering with Ward's criterion which squares the dissimilarities before clustering [@murtaghWardHierarchicalAgglomerative2014]. We chose Euclidean distance to calculate dissimilarities between our variables, which were all continuous and quantitative [**ref**]. As we ran this analysis for an exploratory purpose, we chose arbitrarily a number of clusters beyond the expected major infield/outfield dichotomy, while still aiming for compact clusters of equivalent sizes. We projected our clusters on ordination space with Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) [**ref**] to verify for their consistency and orientation. We compared individual variable distribution between clusters with the Dunn's Kruskal-Wallis test of multiple pairwise comparisons, with family-wise error rate addressed with Bonferroni adjustment [@dunnMultipleComparisonsMeans1961; @dunnMultipleComparisonsUsing1964; @kruskalUseRanksOneCriterion1952].

We then investigated if our variables were driven by either climatic (precipitations, temperature) or nutrient (phosphorus concentration) gradients by fitting single linear models [**ref**]. 

*Prior to analysis, we removed site with outliers* -> **I have one site with a very high phosphorus concentration which crushes all the rest: how sensitive are lms to outliers? I personally would have removed it but maybe there is the way to go around it?**

# RESULTS

<!-- ```{r integer, include=FALSE} -->
<!-- custom_print <- op(d = 0) -->
<!-- ``` -->

We registered a total of `r totplantsp` plant species, among which `r nrow(totforbsp)` forbs, `r nrow(totmonocsp)` monocotyledons, `r nrow(totbryosp)` bryophytes, including mosses and liverworts, and `r nrow(totwoodysp)` shrubs and woody species. We also collected a total of `r totacari` acari and `r totcollem` collembola across all sites.


## Hierarchical clustering

![Cluster projection on Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS).](outputs/cluster_ord.png){#fig-clusterord}
:::

As expected, the sites aggregated into two main groups representing outfields (pink gradient) and infields (orange gradient) respectively, with two seemingly outlying infields (IN10, IN11) and one outfield (CO3) arranged with the other field type (@fig-clustertree). Both groups showed dominant clusters of seven sites, namely C3 for infields and C4 for outfields, with the former being substantially tighter in ordination space compared with the latter (@fig-clusterord). All remaining clusters, two for the outfield group and one for the infield group, were only made of either two or three scattered sites.


![Variable distribution according to clusters](outputs/clusterplots.png){#fig-clusterplots}

When comparing the dominant clusters of each group (C3 and C4), outfields had on average higher LOI (mean~C4~ = `r filter(sheep_summary, cluster == 4)$LOI_mean`, sd~C4~ = `r filter(sheep_summary, cluster == 4)$LOI_sd`; mean~C3~ = `r filter(sheep_summary, cluster == 3)$LOI_mean`, sd~C3~ = `r filter(sheep_summary, cluster == 3)$LOI_sd`), higher diversity of cryptogams (mean~C4~ = `r filter(sheep_summary, cluster == 4)$div_cryptogams_mean`, sd~C4~ = `r filter(sheep_summary, cluster == 4)$div_cryptogams_sd`; mean~C3~ = `r filter(sheep_summary, cluster == 3)$div_cryptogams_mean`, sd~C3~ = `r filter(sheep_summary, cluster == 3)$div_cryptogams_sd`) and woody (mean~C4~ = `r filter(sheep_summary, cluster == 4)$div_woody_mean`, sd~C4~ = `r filter(sheep_summary, cluster == 4)$div_woody_sd`; mean~C3~ = `r filter(sheep_summary, cluster == 3)$div_woody_mean`, sd~C3~ = `r filter(sheep_summary, cluster == 3)$div_woody_sd`) species, and lower diversity of forbs (mean~C4~ = `r filter(sheep_summary, cluster == 4)$div_forbs_mean`, sd~C4~ = `r filter(sheep_summary, cluster == 4)$div_forbs_sd`; mean~C3~ = `r filter(sheep_summary, cluster == 3)$div_forbs_mean`, sd~C3~ = `r filter(sheep_summary, cluster == 3)$div_forbs_sd`) compared with infields (@fig-clusterplots). Within the infield group, C2 and C3 showed very similar diversity patterns but the former had a significantly higher abundance of acari (mean~C2~ = `r filter(sheep_summary, cluster == 2)$ab_acari_mean`, sd~C2~ = `r filter(sheep_summary, cluster == 2)$ab_acari_sd`) compared with the latter (mean~C3~ = `r filter(sheep_summary, cluster == 3)$ab_acari_mean`, sd~C3~ = `r filter(sheep_summary, cluster == 3)$ab_acari_sd`). Within the outfield group, there was no significant differences between the three clusters, but we could nevertheless observe a seemingly higher woody biomass for C1 and highest diversity across all plant functional groups for C5 (@fig-clusterplots).

## Linear models

- correlation mean annual precipitation & average July temperature (R~adj~^2^ = 0.86, F~1,21~ = 134.1, p-value = 1.4.10^-10^) -> variables tested against precipitation only
- LOI decreased with phosphorus concentration (R~adj~^2^ = 0.20, F~1,20~ = 6.36, p-value = 0.02) -> expected
- acari abundance seemingly increased with phosphorus, but low R^2^ and only marginally significant (R~adj~^2^ = 0.10, F~1,20~ = 3.42, p-value = 0.08)
- woody biomass seemingly decreased with phosphorus, but low R^2^ and only marginally significant (R~adj~^2^ = 0.11, F~1,20~ = 3.5, p-value = 0.08)
- woody diversity decreased with phosphorus (R~adj~^2^ = 0.43, F~1,20~ = 16.5, p-value = 0.0006)
- forb diversity increased with phosphorus (R~adj~^2^ = 0.24, F~1,20~ = 7.78, p-value = 0.011) and decreased with precipitation (R~adj~^2^ = 0.18, F~1,20~ = 5.7, p-value = 0.027)
- monocotyledon diversity seemingly decreased with precipitation (R~adj~^2^ = 0.11, F~1,20~ = 3.5, p-value = 0.074)
- cryptogam diversity decreased with phosphorus (R~adj~^2^ = 0.23, F~1,20~ = 7.14, p-value = 0.015) and increased with precipitations (R~adj~^2^ = 0.23, F~1,20~ = 7.28, p-value = 0.014)

# DISCUSSION

## Main results

- Expectations verified as the type of field the main aggregative factor
  - Outfields with higher woody and cryptogtam diversity
  - Infields with faster nutrient cycle and higher forb diversity
  - However infields did not have higher monocotyledon biomass compared with outfields
- Overall, infields more "homogeneous" than outfields
- Functional group diversity overall related to phosphorus gradient, apart monocotyledons
- LOI related to phosphorus concentration -> confirm faster nutrient cycles in infields
- Investigated gradients did not show as appropriate predictors of plant aboveground biomass or mesofauna abundance

## Diversity

- increase cattle density decreases legumes species diversity through increase bare soil (trampling), but increase non-legumes forbs [@buzhdyganDirectIndirectEffects2020]
- in upland areas, overall decrease in species richness over time for both grazed and ungrazed treatments, usually associated with decrease of cryptogam species [@aldayEffectsLongtermRemoval2021]
- biodiversity impoverishment in upland areas mostly regarding abundance of lichens and liverworts despite change in management practices [@milliganWinnersLosersLongterm2016]
- main determinants of vascular species richness: soil moisture > pH > phosphorus; & main determinants of bryophyte species richness: soil moisture > organic matter [@merunkovaEnvironmentalControlSpecies2012]

## Productivity

- effect of grazing intensity on grass, forb & shrub production depends on temperature & precipitation during growing season [@pattonEffectsGrazingIntensity2007]
- effect of grazing intensity on taxonomical & functional diversity stronger in dryer environments @carmonaTaxonomicalFunctionalDiversity2012
- different grazing capacities depending on the habitat type as it is limited by available biomass in nutrient-rich habitats and by nutrient content in nutrient-poor habitats [@gilhausSeasonalVariationsFodder2016]
- response of plant species richness to grazing primarily driven by herbivory-induced changes in community dominance instead of productivity gradient [@koernerChangeDominanceDetermines2018]
- stability of aboveground biomass production in Tibetan alpine meadows correlated with high-palatability herbage stability, which AGB is stimulated by rotational grazing against exclusion, & asynchrony between high & low palatability [@liRotationalGrazingPromotes2020] -> importance of maintaining grazing in upland systems

## Elevation gradient

- direct increase species richness with elevation, but indirect negative effect through decrease soil pH & subsequent decrease earthworms biomass [@buzhdyganDirectIndirectEffects2020]
- use of grazing resources by sheep following an elevation gradient [@mysterudEffectsDensitySeason2007]
- effect bryophyte cover on alpine microclimate @jaroszynskaBryophytesDominatePlant2023
- elevation significantly affected plant Shannon, functional dispersion & evenness but not functional richness in sub-alpine & alpine meadows [@komacFunctionalDiversityGrazing2015]

## Outfields vs infields

- sheep feeding behaviour (e.g. bite rate) different according to habitat (grass vs heather) type [@hesterForagingBehaviourSheep1999]

## Study limitations

- biomass in itself not perfect proxy of nutritive feeding for animals, as chemical composition & plant strategy also affected by climatic gradient -> more defence mechanisms, thus less efficient energy & nutrient uptake under high precipitations conditions [@hopcraftHerbivoresResourcesRisks2010]
- trade-off grazing intensity with forage quality & animal performance in upland (420 masl) meadows [@pavluEffectContinuousGrazing2006]

- time window very small, and potentially not able to capture processes of either biomass production, where rate over year more appropriate than static measurement [@brownImportanceScaleEvaluating1989], and soil fauna activity [**ref from soil course**]
- effect of grazing intensity on biomass production & interaction with temperature & precipitations varied according to time of sampling within grazing season [@pattonEffectsGrazingIntensity2007] -> we did not have control of the timing when the animals where put into the field

## Perspectives

- heaths in uplands very important for biodiversity conservation - carabid species [@eyreRelationshipBritishGround2003]
- trade-off - increase grazing intensity does not always increase productivity, as light & moderate grazing usually maximise fodder production [@pattonEffectsGrazingIntensity2007]
- small-scale farming more likely to have sharper shifts along the multifunctionality gradient due to a narrower range of opportunities, while transition has more chance to be more gradual on large capitalised farms [@wilsonWeakStrongMultifunctionality2008]
- positive relationship between biodiversity and multifunctionality up to a certain level of redundancy which potentially varies according to local conditions [@hectorBiodiversityEcosystemMultifunctionality2007]
- challenge to preserve habitat quality and diversity in areas where farming/management is not anymore economically viable [@kohlerChangesSpeciesComposition2005]
- purpose of rotation & transhumance: to optimise the use of habitats of different productivity, with digestibility & nutrient highest earlier (spring & summer) in nutrient-rich habitats and later (summer & fall) in nutrient-poor habitats [@gilhausSeasonalVariationsFodder2016]
- maintaining grazing in upland areas would ensure plant community stability & preservation plant species richness over time [@speedResponsePlantDiversity2013]
