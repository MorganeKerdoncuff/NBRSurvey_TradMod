# ABSTRACT

The sharp transition from subsistence farming to productivist agriculture globally has simultaneously driven the intensification of fertile lands and the abandonment of less-productive areas, leading to substantial loss of biodiversity and habitats of high ecological value. In Western Norway, the rationalisation of livestock production has transformed the traditional infield-outfield system by focusing the grazing pressure on productive infields at the expense of durable management on coastal and mountain outfields. Encouraging conservation policies towards these remote lands requires to drift from productivity-centered assessments towards a more holistic approach considering biodiversity, ecosystem functions and nature's contributions to people. In an exploratory study of 23 sheep-grazed fields of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, we aimed to investigate the ecological synergies and trade-offs aboveground and belowground between infields and outfields along the fjord system environmental gradient. Overall, locally-adapted management on coastal and mountain outfields have ensured the preservation of cryptogam diversity and carbon sequestration potential, while the low between-site disparity between infields suggests an ongoing homogenisation of more productive farming systems following the intensification of management. Suitable agricultural policies are necessary to support the conservation of multifunctional landscapes at both ends of the productivity gradient and ensure the viability of associated farming systems.

<!-- We found that outfields had higher diversity of shrubs and cryptogams, which was positively correlated with total plant species richness, as well as higher soil carbon content. Infields on the other hand had higher biomass and diversity of forbs, but showed particularly low between-site disparity compared with outfields. -->

# INTRODUCTION

Since the first forest clearings [@prosch-danielsenPalaeoecologicalInvestigationsReconstruction2000], humans have ensured their self-subsistence by transforming nature with a wide range of agricultural practices adapted to the environmental constraints [@ellisLandUseEcological2021; @plieningerTraditionalLanduseNature2006]. To overcome the discrepancy of resources, farmer communities around the world have resorted to remarkably similar strategies based on complementary crop and animal husbandry systems: livestock grazing on low-productive areas provides manure for the edible crops grown on more productive fields, while the crop residues can be recycled as mulch or animal feed [@christiansenInfieldoutfieldSystemsCharacteristics1978; @sekaranRoleIntegratedCroplivestock2021; @yangResearchTrendsCrop2022]. These spatially extensive transfers of energy and nutrients shaped heterogeneous landscapes that have supported a high level of biodiversity and ensured the resilience of the whole agro-ecological system [@altieriLinkingEcologistsTraditional2004; @kremenLandscapesThatWork2018; @tscharntkeOrganicFarmingHarnessing2021]. However these management practices have drastically declined after the Green Revolution, as the introduction of fertiliser and machinery led to the over-intensification of productive lands while remote areas were gradually abandoned [@billenReshapingEuropeanAgrofood2021; @ramankuttyTrendsGlobalAgricultural2018; @reybenayasAbandonmentAgriculturalLand2007; @xieConservationOpportunitiesUncontested2019]. These two concurring trends resulted into an overall homogenisation and degradation of the agricultural landscape, with subsequent loss of the associated biodiversity [@beckmannConventionalLandUse2019; @flynnLossFunctionalDiversity2009; @newboldGlobalEffectsLand2015] and ecosystem functions [@allanLandUseIntensification2015; @isbellNutrientEnrichmentBiodiversity2013] and services [@foleyGlobalConsequencesLand2005; @kwonGlobalEstimatesImpacts2016]. In reaction, the past decades have seen a regained interest towards locally rooted, mixed agricultural systems inherited from the pre-productivist era that would ensure both sustainable land use and socio-economical well-being [@douwevanderploegPeasantriesTwentyfirstCentury2010; @garibaldiFarmingApproachesGreater2017]. 

In Western Norway, the agro-ecological landscape has been safeguarded from severe intensification [@dramstadTenancyNorwegianAgriculture2010; @fjellstadPatternsChangeTwo1999] mainly because of the limiting fjord environment [@ketzlerClimateNorway2021; @nesjeFjordsNorwayComplex2009]. Farmer-fisher communities used to rely on mixed crop-livestock systems, referred as infield-outfield systems [@christiansenInfieldoutfieldSystemsCharacteristics1978], involving transhumance and rotational management to maximise the land use potential from the coast to the mountains [@austadHumaninfluencedVegetationTypes1991; @hjelleHesitantHuntersReview2006; @olssonAgroecosystemsNeolithicTime1991]. Atlantic wet heathland on the flat, notched coastal area would be grazed all year-round and regularly rejuvenated with rotational prescribed burning to improve fodder palatability [@thorvaldsenGammalnorskSauOg2017; @vandvikManagementdrivenEvolutionDomesticated2014]. In mountain areas, subalpine heathlands would be used for sheep and goat summer farming to provide temporary rest for grazing fields in the lowlands [@olssonLandscapeChangePatterns2000; @potthoffChangeMountainSummer2004]. In-between the least productive outfields (*utmark*) [@lillehammerPresentLandscapePerception2007], the large intermediate stretch of more fertile lands would see the development of pluriactive farms encompassing arable lands, grazing fields, hay-meadows and woodlands within a finely grained landscape mosaic of high ecological and cultural values [@haugeGaldaneLaerdalWestern1988; @hetlandPluriactivityStrategyEmployment1986; @olssonAgroecosystemsNeolithicTime1991]. The productivism trend emerging after WWII led to the rationalisation of livestock production, with a shift of grazing animals to fertilised infields (*innmark*) and a subsequent increase of farm size [@dramstadTenancyNorwegianAgriculture2010; @forbordDriversChangeNorwegian2014; @jonesLandtenureLandscapeChange1988]. On the other hand remote outfields were gradually abandoned [@fjellstadPatternsChangeTwo1999; @hamreLandcoverStructuralChanges2007a], causing the joint loss of cultural knowledge and ecological diversity associated with traditional management of hay-meadows [@norderhaugBiotopePatternsAbundance2000; @wehnAdaptiveBiodiversityManagement2018], coastal heathlands [@lundbergAustevollChangingCoastal1991; @webbTraditionalManagementEuropean1998] and mountain summer farms [@noelEffectsAbandonmentAlpine2010; @olssonLandscapeChangePatterns2000; @potthoffChangeMountainSummer2004]. The deep and lasting socio-economic decline of the countryside that followed has made particularly challenging any policy attempt to halt the land abandonment process, let alone reverse it [@blekesauneAgricultureImportanceViability1999; @daugstadAgricultureUpholderCultural2006; @forbordDriversChangeNorwegian2014].

In this context, the nature's contributions to people (NCP) framework offers a useful toolbox for facilitating conservation measures towards less productive areas [@diazAssessingNatureContributions2018]: as a more inclusive update of the ecosystem service framework [@ellisEcosystemServicesNature2019; @haines-youngCommonInternationalClassification2018], it provides 1) quantitative assessments of the direct and indirect benefits driven by the farmers and their management [@bengtssonGrasslandsMoreImportant2019; @bernuesSeeingNorthernEuropean2016], 2) theoretical support for policy-oriented concepts such as multifunctionality [@bjorkhaugMultifunctionalAgriculturePolicy2008; @wilsonWeakStrongMultifunctionality2008] and 3) intuitive methodology for engaging stakeholders and the general public through participatory approaches [@cusensParticipatoryMappingReveals2022]. Examining semi-natural habitats beyond the productivity lenses allows to highlight the values of less fertile areas [@patru-stupariuReviewChangesMountain2020; @walmsleyEnsuringLongtermProvision2021] while identifying the ecological trade-offs generated by different grazing regimes [@geertsemaActionableKnowledgeEcological2016; @germanRelationshipsMultipleAspects2017]. In coastal and subalpine heathlands, slower nutrient cycling process due water saturation and/or cold temperature limit primary production but in return enhance carbon sequestration in the soil [@liLongtermTemporalPatterns2023; @quinCallunaVulgarisdominatedUpland2015]. The very low grazing pressure creates a structurally heterogeneous and colorful landscape highly appreciated for outdoor activities [@tilleyAnthropologyLandscape2017] and maintains a thick and highly functionally diverse bryophyte layer [@austrheimPlantDiversityPatterns2002] that contributes to freshwater supply and regulation [@huStructuralCharacteristicsMoss2023].

The recent designation of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve (NBR) as model area for experimenting and implementing the Sustainable Development Goals in Western Norway [@unescoNewRoadmapMan2017] has supported ecosystem services-based research in both agricultural and non-agricultural habitats [@cusensSocioculturalValuesBiophysical2024; @demeauxJustGrazeIt2024]. In this paper, we focused on the land uses inherited from the infield-outfield system, which is familiar to both policymakers and the general public, to investigate ecological trade-offs along the coast-to-mountain gradient. We first verified whether characterising grazing areas into either infield or outfield was still ecologically relevant through clustering analysis (Q1): as field type reflects both inherent productivity and associated past and current management, we predicted it to be the main factor of site aggregation (H1-A), followed by the geographical area (H1-B). Secondly, we relied on the clustering results to investigate trade-offs between primary production and plant functional group diversity aboveground (Q2-A), and between soil productivity and carbon sequestration belowground (Q2-B). We expected fertile sites to be less diverse, dominated by more palatable groups (forbs, monocotyledons) and with abundant soil mesofauna, and low-productive sites to be characterised by a more species-rich, stress-tolerant vegetation (shrubs, cryptogams) and a high rate of soil oragnic carbon.

The Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve (NBR) encompasses in a nutshell the main features of the fjord system in Western Norway [@kalandNordhordlandBiosphereReserve2018]: the sharp elevation gradient creates a tight transition between the mild, oceanic regime on the west and the alpine regime on the east with decreasing temperatures and increasing precipitations [@ketzlerClimateNorway2021]. Between the coast and the mountains, mean annual precipitation can vary up to twice as much (from 1550 to 4800 mm) and mean July temperature can drop by almost half (from 15.9 to 8.3°C), along with increasing annual temperature range [@meteorologiskinstituttNorskKlimaservicesenter2023]. The region can thus be coarsely divided into three main ecological zones (adapted from @uttakleivLandskapskartleggingNorgeLandscape2011): the coastal area, mostly made of flat islets and peninsulas, which have been used for both outfields and infields; the fjord area, characterised by productive infields in the valleys while the sharp slopes are covered by forests; the mountain area, up to 1300 masl, essentially used for summer outfields.

In summer 2019 and 2020. we conducted an ecological survey on 23 grazing fields spread along the whole elevation gradient of the NBR, with 11 infields in the coastal and fjord areas and 12 outfields mainly located in the coastal and mountain areas (@fig-sitemap). Coastal and fjord sites were all located below 200 masl and showed on average similar July temperature (`r op(mean(coastal$avgtempJuly))`-`r op(mean(fjord$avgtempJuly))`°C) and annual precipitation (`r op(mean(coastal$annualprecipitation), 0)`-`r op(mean(fjord$annualprecipitation), 0)` mm) ranges. Mountain sites were located between 600 and 875 masl and characterised by colder climate (`r op(mean(mountain$avgtempJuly))`°C) and higher precipitation level (`r op(mean(mountain$annualprecipitation), 0)` mm) [@meteorologiskinstituttNorskKlimaservicesenter2023]. The fields were selected according to the Norwegian "areal type" AR5 classification system [@ahlstromAR5Klassifikasjonssystem2019], which defines infields (*innmarksbeite*) as "*agricultural lands that cannot be harvested mechanically* \[with\] *at least 50% of the area* \[...\] *covered with cultured grass or pasture-tolerant herbs*". There is no specific areal category for outfields, but they were located on "open permanent lands" (*åpen fastmark*) which are described as "*areas that are neither a bog, agricultural, forest or infrastructure*". Information on the sites management were collected from phone interviews with farmers, conducted from October 2021 to January 2022.

Coastal outfields were *Calluna vulgaris* dominated heathlands, grazed all year round by rustic sheep breeds such as the Norwegian old sheep (*Gammel Norsk Sau*) or the Cheviot sheep from Scotland (*Sjeviotsau*). Three of them (CO1-3) were still managed with rotational prescribed burning and showed different stages of heath regeneration. The only outfield visited in the fjord area resulted from a former forest clearing and was dominated by *Vaccinium myrtillus* and *Galium saxatile*. In the mountain area, outfields were large areas that could be grazed by several sheep flocks from both the rustic breeds and the conventional Norwegian white sheep (*Norsk Kvit Sau*) for at most 4 months during the summer season. Our sites were dominated by ericaceous shrubs (*Vaccinium* spp) with a well-developed bryophyte layer. Infields were permanent grasslands dominated by *Agrostis capillaris*-*Poa pratensis* assemblages in the more fertile sites and by *Festuca rubra* in less productive areas. In both cases the layer of creeping vegetation was well-represented by species such as *Galium saxatile* and *Potentilla erecta*. The management was highly variable between farms: the fields were grazed from 3 to 12 months with both rustic and conventional breeds and 7 out of 11 sites were enriched with either artificial fertiliser, manure and/or shell/sand-lime mix.

## Data collection

We visited each field once between mid-June and mid-August according to the "spring" bloom occurring first in the coastal area and in the late season in the mountain area. The sampling area was when possible a 20 x 20 m square, if not a 40 x 10 m stripe, representative of the surrounding vegetation and avoiding rocks, waterlogged ground, trees and field edges. We nested three plots of 3 x 3 m separated by at least 6 m from each other and themselves divided into nine quadrats of 1 m^2^. Five quadrats were dedicated to the non-destructive inventory of plant species and the remaining four quadrats were used for biomass and/or soil sampling (@fig-sampling).

All vascular plants and bryophyte species within each non-destructive quadrat were identified to the species level and attributed a percent of abundance-cover by one of the same two observers (15 replicates per site). When possible, vascular plants were identified with the Nordic flora [@mossbergGyldendalsStoreNordiske2018] on site. Non-identified species, including all bryophytes and lycophytes, were collected and brought to expert identification. Aboveground standing biomass was collected in a 0.5 x 0.5 m^2^ quadrat once per plot (3 replicates per site) by cutting vegetation as close to the ground as possible while avoiding the litter. The samples were stored in the freezer (-20°C) before processing. We sorted the standing vegetation into woody, vascular and cryptogams and weighted the dry biomass after 48h in the oven at 65°C. We sampled soil with a stainless steel cylindrical core of 200 cm^3^ (diam. 10.5 cm; height 12 cm) in each destructive quadrat and stored it at 9°C before lab processing. For each plot, one core out of four (3 replicates per site) was used for Berlese-Tullgren extraction of mesofauna [@tullgrenSehrEinfacherAusleseapparat1918], with aluminium funnels of 62 cm height, 33.5 cm top diameter and 5.3 cm exit diameter. The soil was kept under heating lamps (50 W) for 96 hours on 2 cm mesh size grids at a distance of approximately 40 cm from the bulb to allow the surface to slowly dry. The extracted samples were stored in 70% ethanol for sorting and counting of acari and collembola. The three remaining soil cores were sieved and merged at the plot level (3 replicates per site) for the determination of loss of ignition (LOI) in a certified analysis laboratory.

## Data analysis

All analyses were performed on R (v.4.4.1) with R-Studio (v.2023.12.1+402) [@positteamRStudioIntegratedDevelopment2023; @rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2024], using the *fpc* [@hennigFpcFlexibleProcedures2024] and *mri* [@cugmasMriModifiedRand2019] packages for clustering validation, the *rcompanion* package for effect size statistics [@mangiaficoRcompanionFunctionsSupport2024] and the *ggplot2* package for visualisation [@wickhamGgplot2CreateElegant2024]. All our variables were scaled prior to analysis to account for unit differences.

To check if the observed site distribution reflected the field type classification (H1-A) and/or the geographical area (H1-B), we performed Ward's hierarchical agglomerative clustering on Euclidean-based distance matrix, which minimises within-group dispersion by computing squared dissimilarities [@murtaghWardHierarchicalAgglomerative2014]. We compared the observed primary (first-level branching) and secondary (second-level branching) clusters with the expected clustering according to field type and the combination field type x geographical area respectively using both the more common adjusted Rand index [@gordonClassification1999] and the adjusted Wallace index which is not sensitive to cluster size [@warrensUnderstandingAdjustedRand2022]. The secondary clusters were projected on Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) for visual representation [@minchinEvaluationRelativeRobustness1987]. 

For ecological synergies and trade-offs (Q2), we first investigated correlations between variables independently of site affiliation using Spearman's rank test [@hollanderNonparametricStatisticalMethods2015]. We then made pairwise comparisons between primary and secondary clusters using non-parametric unpaired Mann-Whitney tests [@lehmannNonparametricsStatisticalMethods2006]. We assessed the magnitude of the effect size with the Glass rank biserial correlation coefficient, which is not affected by sample size [@kingStatisticalReasoningBehavioral2018].

<!-- and were classified into three categories: 1) diversity, including average species richness of cryptogams (bryophytes and lycophytes), monocotyledons, forbs and woody plants per m^2^; 2) production, including average aboveground biomass of cryptogams, monocotyledons, forbs and woody plants per m^2^; 3) decomposition, including average abundance of collembola and acari per m^2^ and average LOI. -->

We registered a total of `r op(nrow(totplantsp), 0)` plant species, among which `r op(nrow(totforbsp), 0)` forbs, `r op(nrow(totmonocsp), 0)` monocotyledons, `r op(nrow(totcryptosp), 0)` cryptogams, including mosses, liverworts and lycophytes, and `r op(nrow(totwoodysp), 0)` shrubs and woody species. We also collected a total of `r op(sum(mesobio_sheep$Acari), 0)` acari and `r op(sum(mesobio_sheep$Collembola), 0)` collembola across all sites.

## Hierarchical clustering

We obtained two primary clusters (A-B) and four secondary clusters (CL1-4) (@fig-clustertree) which show relatively consistent compactness and separation (see @tbl-clusterquality in SI). Outfields (A) were clearly separated from infields (B) in the first branching (adjusted Rand Index = `r op(filter(clusterstat, Clustering == "primary")$AdjRandIndex, 2)`; adjusted Wallace Index = `r op(clusterstat$AdjWallaceIndex[1], 2)`), with only two mismatched infields (FI6, CI5) and one mismatched outfield (FO1) (@fig-clustertree). The influence of the geographical area was on the other hand less straightforward  as only visible among outfields (adjusted Rand Index = `r op(clusterstat$AdjRandIndex[2], 2)`; adjusted Wallace Index = `r op(clusterstat$AdjWallaceIndex[2], 2)`) which were distinctly less compacted than infields (@fig-clusterord).

## Ecological trade-offs and synergies

```{r averagespfield, include=FALSE}

avgrichness <- left_join(subset(landuse_sheep, select = c(SiteID, FieldType)), plantrichness_sheep)

# Average infield richness
avginfieldsp <- filter(avgrichness, FieldType == "infield")

# Average outfield richness
avgoutfieldsp <- filter(avgrichness, FieldType == "outfield")
```

Independently of field type and geographical area, woody biomass, woody species richness, cryptogam species richness, total plant species richness and loss of ignition were strongly positively correlated and were overall negatively correlated with forb diversity (@fig-corpanel). Average plant species richness was `r op(mean(avginfieldsp$DIV_tot))` for infields and `r op(mean(avgoutfieldsp$DIV_tot))` for outfields.

When comparing primary clusters A and B, outfields had higher soil organic content (mean~ClA~ = `r op(filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 1)$C_LOI_mean)` &plusmn; sd~ClA~ = `r op(filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 1)$C_LOI_sd)` % dry weight; mean~ClB~ = `r op(filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 2)$C_LOI_mean)` &plusmn; `r op(filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 2)$C_LOI_sd)` % dry weight), higher woody biomass (mean~ClA~ = `r op(filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 1)$AGP_woody_mean)` &plusmn; `r op(filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 1)$AGP_woody_sd)` g.m^-2^; mean~ClB~ = `r op(filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 2)$AGP_woody_mean)` &plusmn; `r op(filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 2)$AGP_woody_sd)` g.m^-2^), and higher species richness of cryptogams (mean~ClA~ = `r op(filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 1)$DIV_cryptogams_mean)` &plusmn; `r op(filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 1)$DIV_cryptogams_sd)`; mean~ClB~ = `r op(filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 2)$DIV_cryptogams_mean)` &plusmn; `r op(filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 2)$DIV_cryptogams_sd)`) and shrubs (mean~ClA~ = `r op(filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 1)$DIV_woody_mean)` &plusmn; `r op(filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 1)$DIV_woody_sd)`; mean~ClB~ = `r op(filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 2)$DIV_woody_mean)` &plusmn; `r op(filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 2)$DIV_woody_sd)`). On the other hand, infields had higher forb biomass (mean~ClA~ = `r op(filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 1)$AGP_forbs_mean)` &plusmn; `r op(filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 1)$AGP_forbs_sd)` g.m^-2^; mean~ClB~ = `r op(filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 2)$AGP_forbs_mean)` &plusmn; `r op(filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 2)$AGP_forbs_sd)` g.m^-2^) and species richness (mean~ClA~ = `r op(filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 1)$DIV_forbs_mean)` &plusmn; `r op(filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 1)$DIV_forbs_sd)`; mean~ClB~ = `r op(filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 2)$DIV_forbs_mean)` &plusmn; `r op(filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 2)$DIV_forbs_sd)`) (@fig-clusterplots A). Coastal outfields from secondary cluster 1 showed on average higher biomass of cryptogams (mean~Cl1~ = `r op(filter(sheep_summary_sec, cluster_sec == 1)$AGP_cryptogams_mean)` &plusmn; `r op(filter(sheep_summary_sec, cluster_sec == 1)$AGP_cryptogams_sd)` g.m^-2^; mean~Cl4~ = `r op(filter(sheep_summary_sec, cluster_sec == 4)$AGP_cryptogams_mean)` &plusmn; `r op(filter(sheep_summary_sec, cluster_sec == 4)$AGP_cryptogams_sd)` g.m^-2^) and shrubs (mean~Cl1~ = `r op(filter(sheep_summary_sec, cluster_sec == 1)$AGP_woody_mean)` &plusmn; `r op(filter(sheep_summary_sec, cluster_sec == 1)$AGP_woody_sd)`; mean~Cl4~ = `r op(filter(sheep_summary_sec, cluster_sec == 4)$AGP_woody_mean)` &plusmn; `r op(filter(sheep_summary_sec, cluster_sec == 4)$AGP_woody_sd)` g.m^-2^) compared with mountain outfields in cluster 4 (@fig-clusterplots B). Regarding infields, the only factor distinguishing the three sites of cluster 3 from the other sites gathered in cluster 2 was the distinctly higher density of acari (mean~Cl2~ = `r op(filter(sheep_summary_sec, cluster_sec == 1)$BGP_acari_mean)` &plusmn; `r op(filter(sheep_summary_sec, cluster_sec == 2)$BGP_acari_sd)` m^-2^; mean~Cl3~ = `r op(filter(sheep_summary_sec, cluster_sec == 3)$BGP_acari_mean)` &plusmn; `r op(filter(sheep_summary_sec, cluster_sec == 3)$BGP_acari_sd)` m^-2^) (@fig-clusterplots C).

# DISCUSSION

The first clustering level of grazing fields mostly matched with the Norwegian land cover classification (H1-A), with substantially higher between-site dispersion for outfields compared with infields. The influence of geographical area partially showed in the outfield group, but was completely absent for infields (H1-B). As expected, higher fodder production in infields was associated with higher forb species richness but overall lower plant diversity (H2-A), which was closely correlated with cryptogam and shrub species richness, while carbon sequestration was clearly more efficient in outfields (H2-B). However soil mesofauna was not related to any other variable and did not show any clear pattern according to field type or geographical area.

## Productivity-diversity trade-offs in the current NBR farming system

The land type dichotomy resulting from the "traditional" infield-outfield system of Western Norway durably imprinted the fjord agro-ecological landscape and still reflects rather accurately the divergence of community assembly processes according to nutrient availability. In enriched grasslands, plant-plant interactions are determined by strong light competition [@conradiResourceAvailabilityDetermines2017; @grimeCompetitiveExclusionHerbaceous1973] and higher grazing and trampling pressures [@buzhdyganDirectIndirectEffects2020], which tend to the dominance of fast-growing and short-lived species [@gaujourFactorsProcessesAffecting2012; @koernerChangeDominanceDetermines2018; @pakemanConsistencyPlantSpecies2004]. In nutrient-poor heathland habitats, grazing at very low intensity locally overcomes the light competition driven by shrubs [@koernerChangeDominanceDetermines2018; @olffEffectsHerbivoresGrassland1998] and creates patch-like structural heterogeneity [@parsonsSpatialHeterogeneityGrazing2003; @tonnGrazingInducedPatchiness2019] that particularly favours cryptogam diversity in subalpine environment [@aldayEffectsLongtermRemoval2021; @milliganWinnersLosersLongterm2016].

We can however question whether this productivity-diversity trade-off observed between field types solely relates to the intrinsic nutrient status of grassland and heathland habitats, or if the intensification of land use, even if only up to a moderate range, has impoverished the NBR semi-natural grasslands over time [@beckmannConventionalLandUse2019]. In that sense, the striking homogeneity displayed within the infield group compared with outfields suggests the latter. Even if infields are not distributed across such a large environmental gradient as outfields, a clear distinction between oceanic and boreal meadows was described by @losvikHayMeadowCommunities1993 but has yet to be reported in more recent studies [@demeauxJustGrazeIt2024]. More generally, a stronger between-site disparity should be expected from the inherent heterogeneity of the NBR agro-ecological system [@steinEnvironmentalHeterogeneityUniversal2014] stemming from both environmental (e.g. topography) and management (e.g. grazing periodicity) factors [@fynnManagingBrowsingGrazing2019; @hesterForagingBehaviourSheep1999; @ravettoenriBiodiversityfriendlyRotationalGrazing2017]. Increasing grazing pressure up to moderate levels has so far shown very mixed results on either species richness [@herrero-jaureguiEffectsGrazingIntensity2018; @scohierHowSheepAffect2012; @wangGlobalMetaanalysesResponse2019] or community composition [@marriottLongtermImpactsExtensive2009; @pakemanLongTermImpacts2019], but in Western Norway the effects could be aggravated by the very low grassland carrying capacity (under 5 animals per km^2^/y) [@piipponenGlobalTrendsGrassland2022] and the dominance of steep slopes [@dorroughPlantNeighbourhoodLandscape2007]. More importantly, the generalised application of mineral fertilisers, or even manure [@koningerManureManagementSoil2021], was shown to be particularly detrimental to bryophytes and rare vascular species [@kiddImpacts120Years2017; @kleijnSearchKeyBiogeochemical2008; @kleijnRelationshipFarmlandBiodiversity2009].

On the contrary, the high disparity between outfields suggests that current management strategies are adapted to local conditions and enhance the regional diversity of semi-natural heathlands [@speedResponsePlantDiversity2013]. In cold-stressed subalpine habitats, extensive summer grazing by free-ranging sheep generates enough disturbance to contain the progress of the tree line [@brynElevationalTreelineForest2018; @hofgaardTreeRecruitmentTreeline2009] while preserving the cryptogam species richness [@austrheimPlantSpeciesDiversity2001; @kaufmannEffectsClimateChange2021] and the nutritive quality of the fodder [@marrsReleaseSheepGrazing2020; @niuTradeoffsForageQuality2016]. Under the mild Southern coastal climate though, the vegetation grows more rapidly into mature, shrub-dominated heath stands which require more active management to prevent encroachment [@velleDoesPrescribedBurning2014]. Rather than increasing the overall stocking density that could lead to nutrient depletion and landscape homogenisation [@gilhausSeasonalVariationsFodder2016; @pakemanIncreasedGrazingDrives2021], farmers rely on rotational prescribed burning to regularly rejuvenate patches of heath into more palatable pioneer stages [@hobbsStudiesFireScottish1984; @mallikRegenerationHeathlandPlants1983; @thorvaldsenGammalnorskSauOg2017], locally altering ecological niches [@velleSuccessionPrescribedBurning2014] and successional processes [@marenChangingContributionsStochastic2018]. Over time, this practice creates temporally and spatially dynamic mosaics of heath stands under different regeneration stages [@bargmannSpeciesTraitSelection2016] which shape ecological heterogeneity at both local and regional scales [@smithResolvingHeatedDebate2023; @vandvikManagingHeterogeneityImportance2005]. 

<!-- - the management balance to prevent both encroachment and overgrazing is substantially tighter and therefore requires [@austrheimSynergiesTradeoffsEcosystem2016].   -->
<!-- - the application of mineral fertilisers acidify the soil and increase the concentration of ammonium and ionic aluminium [@brittoNH4ToxicityHigher2002; @kochianCellularMechanismsAluminum1995]. Manure is usually reported to be less impactful [@caiIntensifiedSoilAcidification2015; @xuModelbasedOptimalManagement2023], but only up to a certain amount [@koningerManureManagementSoil2021].  -->
<!-- This process is particularly aggravating in Norway where the soil pH is already the lowest in Europe because of the predominance of acid crystalline rocks and colder climate [@fabianGEMASSpatialDistribution2014; @norgesgeologiskeundersokelseNasjonalBerggrunnsdatabase2023]. -->
<!-- showing for instance through the wide extent of topographical conditions from steep, well-drained slopes to flat, well-irrigated areas [@fynnManagingBrowsingGrazing2019; @hesterForagingBehaviourSheep1999; @ravettoenriBiodiversityfriendlyRotationalGrazing2017] or the highly variable grazing periodicity from 2 months to all year round [@ravettoenriBiodiversityfriendlyRotationalGrazing2017]. -->
<!-- - Even if cryptogams are good indicators of multidiversity [@manningGrasslandManagementIntensification2015] -->
<!-- - different grazing capacities depending on the habitat type as it is limited by available biomass in nutrient-rich habitats and by nutrient content in nutrient-poor habitats [@gilhausSeasonalVariationsFodder2016] -->

## Soil carbon and biotic-abiotic interactions

As expected, heathlands showed better carbon sequestration potential than grasslands [@quinCallunaVulgarisdominatedUpland2015], independently of geographical area. Because of low drainage capacity and/or very high precipitation levels, both coastal and subalpine soils are under anoxic, water-saturated conditions that hinder the microbial activity driving the decomposition of organic matter [@boyeThermodynamicallyControlledPreservation2017; @hobbieControlsCarbonStorage2000]. Furthermore, the litter from shrubs and especially bryophytes was shown to decompose considerably slower [@langExperimentalComparisonChemical2009], especially on acidic substrate [@vanzuijlenDecomposabilityLichensBryophytes2020]. Carbon stabilisation in the soil is however highly context-dependent [@dungaitSoilOrganicMatter2012; @schmidtPersistenceSoilOrganic2011] and relies on a very sensitive flux balance favoured by active management, such as the regular rejunevation of coastal *Calluna* communities [@liLongtermTemporalPatterns2023] or the seasonal low-intensity grazing in mountain habitats [@martinsenCarbonStorageLowalpine2011; @poeplauTemporalDynamicsSoil2011].

Surprisingly though, soil organic carbon concentration was completely unrelated to the density of Collembola or Acari, which neither showed any pattern associated with aboveground biomass, plant diversity, field type or geographical area. Soil mesofauna would be expected to stimulate the decomposition process [@garcia-palaciosClimateLitterQuality2013; @kampichlerRoleMicroarthropodsTerrestrial2009; @songContributionsSoilMesofauna2020] both directly, as feeders releasing feces that generate more microbial activity than litter when fresh [@jolyDetritivoreConversionLitter2020; @nakatsukaSoilFaunalEffect2020], and indirectly, by connecting the stationary micro-organisms with nutrients and thus triggering pulses of microbial activity [@brionesSerendipitousValueSoil2018; @erktanPhysicalStructureSoil2020]. However, depending on the context these processes can also deliver opposing effects [@angstConceptualizingSoilFauna2024; @frouzEffectsSoilMacro2018], such as the drop of decomposition rate of fecal pellets with time due to aggregate formation [@maassFunctionalRoleMicroarthropods2015] or the priming effect favouring mineralisation after a sudden increase in dissolved organic carbon [@frouzSoilFaunaReduce2020]. With such contradicting interactions being more rules than exceptions in the soil system, formally interpreting the relationship between mesofauna and soil organic matter is particularly challenging [@angstConceptualizingSoilFauna2024; @frouzEffectsSoilMacro2018; @lehmannPersistenceSoilOrganic2020].

Additional uncertainties are to be expected from the variation in nutrient availability both between and among field types, especially considering the high discrepancy of enrichment practices in infields. Fertilisation can either increase microbial biomass by enhancing nutrient supply [@geisselerLongtermEffectsMineral2014], or on the contrary limit it by for instance acidifying the soil or reaching nitrogen saturation [@tresederNitrogenAdditionsMicrobial2008; @wallensteinNitrogenFertilizationDecreases2006], both impacting soil fauna through bottom-up processes [@schmitzTrophicExploitationGrassland1993; @sunEffectNitrogenPhosphorus2017; @zhangPhosphorusAdditionIncreases2023]. Overall, organic fertilisers have been more consistently reported to increase mesofauna density compared with artificial fertilisers [@betancur-corredorOrganicNitrogenFertilization2023; @heinenCombiningOrganicFertilisation2023; @jiangDiversityAbundanceSoil2015], which negative impacts seem to prevail [@degraaffEffectsAgriculturalIntensification2019]. The enhancing effect of soil enrichment in grasslands however seems to reach a plateau within a few years [@bittmanResponsesBacterialFungal2005; @betancur-corredorOrganicNitrogenFertilization2023], while the loss in abundance and diversity of soil fauna appears rather long-lasting [@birkhoferFertilizationRapidlyAlters2022].

From a methodological perspective though, neither the relationships of soil mesofauna with soil carbon or nutrient enrichment are uniform across taxa, and solely relying on total Collembola and Acari density undoubtedly limited the interpretation range of our study. For instance, Acari response to either soil organic matter [@arnottUplandGrasslandHabitats2021; @fergusonChangesTrophicAbundance2001; @georgeEvaluationMesofaunaCommunities2017] or fertilisation [@betancur-corredorOrganicNitrogenFertilization2023; @birkhoferFertilizationRapidlyAlters2022; @caoChangesAbundanceStructure2011] mostly reflects the dominance between the essentially fungivorous Oribatida and the predatory Mesostigmata in the community. Distinguishing these two groups may have provided hints on why three infields distinctly showed higher Acari densities, which did not appear like sampling artifacts as all samples shared similar approximate sizes. Similarly to Acari, fungivorous Collembola were shown to be accurate indicators of labile carbon availability [@devriesSoilFoodWeb2013] when total abundance only marginally varies across habitat types [@cluzeauIntegrationBiodiversitySoil2012; @sousaChangesCollembolaRichness2006]. Detritivores and bacterivores also responded differently to phosphorus addition, showing hump-shaped and linear patterns respectively [@zhangPhosphorusAdditionIncreases2023], suggesting a shift in the community composition which may not affect the overall density at coarse taxonomic level [@arnottUplandGrasslandHabitats2021; @cluzeauIntegrationBiodiversitySoil2012]. Thus, in order to have a better understand of the sensitivity of soil fauna to land use changes, more research is needed on trophic interactions and the biotic control of carbon and nutrient fluxes [@lozanofondonIndirectEffectsTrophic2023], by relying on innovative methodologies suitable for the specific spatio-temporal dynamics of the soil system [@bardgettBelowgroundBiodiversityEcosystem2014; @geisenMethodologicalFrameworkEmbrace2019].

<!-- - Colder climate in the subalpine region should amplify this process [@hobbieControlsCarbonStorage2000], but the elevation range of our study (below 900 masl) may have been too limited to show a clear temperature effect.  -->
<!-- - even though neutral or positive effects were also observed [@betancur-corredorOrganicNitrogenFertilization2023] for instance when combined with lime [@coleRelatingMicroarthropodCommunity2005]. -->
<!-- - combination of organic nitrogen fertilisation and mineral phosphorus fertilisation increased both Collembola & Acari density compared with unfertilised [@sunEffectNitrogenPhosphorus2017] -->
<!-- - while the cover of grasses and legumes in the infields should have enhanced feeding activity [@birkhoferSoilFaunaFeeding2011; @sabaisPlantSpeciesRichness2011]. -->
<!-- - Acari decreased with elevation, leading to a dominance shift towards Collembola [@jiangCompositionSpatialDistribution2015] -->
<!-- - collembola abundance as good proxy of soil mesofauna feeding activity [@birkhoferSoilFaunaFeeding2011] -->
<!-- - highest abundance across all fields FI4 (IS3 - Eikemo) - CI1 (OS2 - Morken) - FI1 (IV1 - Hopsdal) -> nothing to compare (and it shows as sites are quite far from each other) -->
<!-- - but the insights on biochemical recalcitrance grained from experimental individual decomposition rates do not match/cannot explained long-term turn-over patterns and summarising litter quality is reductive and non-representative [@dungaitSoilOrganicMatter2012; @schmidtPersistenceSoilOrganic2011] -->
<!-- - belowground allocation of the biomass, which has a better carbon stabilisation potential [@schmidtPersistenceSoilOrganic2011] -->

## Conservation perspectives

Despite the evolution of practices following the rationalisation of livestock production, the infield-outfield terminology is still an ecologically and socially relevant reference for guiding agricultural policies in Western Norway [@asheimPolicyMeasuresPreserve2020; @huberFarmTypologiesUnderstanding2024]. Beyond the formal classification of grazing fields, it reflects locally adapted farming systems which complementarity allows to maximise the agro-ecological potential of the whole fjord gradient [@billenReshapingEuropeanAgrofood2021]. For instance summer transhumance, which was initiated as a mean to release grazing pressure from the lowland by making use of the tight productivity peak in the mountain ranges [@gilhausSeasonalVariationsFodder2016; @potthoffChangeMountainSummer2004], has shaped the remote upland areas into multifunctional landscapes of high ecological interest [@koernerChangeDominanceDetermines2018; @speedResponsePlantDiversity2013], providing among other: additional sources of income through cheese production [@daugstadAgricultureUpholderCultural2006]; key regulating services of water quality and carbon storage [@huStructuralCharacteristicsMoss2023; @liLongtermTemporalPatterns2023]; deep-rooted cultural heritage bringing a sense of belonging and artistic inspiration to the local community [@beleHeritageBoundariesNatureculture2024]. With the decline of family farming, what spontaneously emerged as secondary benefits has become the main motive for the conservation of remote areas and their associated management practices [@bernuesQuantifyingMultifunctionalityFjord2015; @wilsonWeakStrongMultifunctionality2008]. 

Emphasizing highly valued biodiversity and multifunctionality on coastal and mountain outfields should however not be at the cost of reducing infields to their fodder production role. Semi-natural grasslands in Western Norway result from a long history of low-intensity, rotational-based grazing management, deeply socially-anchored [@cusensParticipatoryMappingReveals2022; @johansenCeasedGrazingManagement2019], which has ensured the viability of the agrosystem over time [@isbellBenefitsIncreasingPlant2017; @marriottLongtermImpactsExtensive2009] while promoting high level of diversity across scales [@hamrePlantSpeciesRichness2010; @hendrickxHowLandscapeStructure2007; @lichtenbergGlobalSynthesisEffects2017]. The high proportion of forb species especially, which represented on average about 40% of the total plant richness in our infields, is a major nectar resource for pollinators [@goulnikFloralTraitFunctional2020; @woodcockEnhancingFloralResources2014] that cannot be replicated in any other habitat type within the agricultural landscape [@ockingerSeminaturalGrasslandsPopulation2007]. Species-rich grasslands also show higher carbon sequestration potential [@baiGrasslandSoilCarbon2022; @pastoreSensitivityGrasslandCarbon2021; @yangSoilCarbonSequestration2019], further maintained if not enhanced by low stocking rate [@soussanaMitigatingGreenhouseGas2010; @viglizzoReassessingRoleGrazing2019], nitrogen fertilisation [@ceniniChronicNitrogenFertilization2015; @fornaraMultinutrientVsNitrogenonly2013] or local environmental context [@hobbieControlsCarbonStorage2000; @poeplauTemporalDynamicsSoil2011]. For example in our study, even if on average soil organic matter content was higher in outfields the maxima were actually recorded in two infields, respectively a coastal flood plain (CI5) and a former forest clearing (FI6). Emphasizing the multifunctionality potential of more productive grazing systems is thus as essential to control if not counteract the concurring intensification and homogenisation processes [@hectorBiodiversityEcosystemMultifunctionality2007; @wilsonWeakStrongMultifunctionality2008] which, even though "moderate" to current standards, have durably impacted the NBR agro-ecological landscape [@auneLossSeminaturalGrassland2018; @norderhaugBiotopePatternsAbundance2000].

<!-- - Overall richness higher in low-intensity farming compared to high-intensity farming [@gonthierBiodiversityConservationAgriculture2014] -->
<!-- - correlation patches with high richness typical semi-natural grassland species, remnant semi-natural grassland patches & man-made structure with long continuity -> restoration former grassland favour both ecological and cultural values [@hamrePlantSpeciesRichness2010] -->
<!-- - Productivity can be stable or decline under more intensive sheep grazing, while extensive sheep grazing did not increase the proportion of undesirable species such as Cirsium, Juncus, Rumex [@marriottLongtermImpactsExtensive2009] -->
<!-- - effect of grazing intensity on grass, forb & shrub production depends on temperature & precipitation during growing season, but overall light to moderate grazing intensity maximise forage production [@pattonEffectsGrazingIntensity2007] -->

<!-- - infield-outfield strategy regaining popularity for control over the N cycle in agriculture by limiting import and leakages [@billenReshapingEuropeanAgrofood2021] -->
<!-- - biomass in itself not perfect proxy of nutritive feeding for animals, as chemical composition & plant strategy also affected by climatic gradient -> more defence mechanisms, thus less efficient energy & nutrient uptake under high precipitations conditions [@hopcraftHerbivoresResourcesRisks2010] -->
<!-- - trade-off grazing intensity with forage quality & animal performance in upland (420 masl) meadows [@pavluEffectContinuousGrazing2006] -->

# CONCLUSION

Considering the latent erosion of the ecological state of the agro-ecological landscape in Western Norway, either due to intensification or abandonment, it is necessary to redirect agricultural subsidies schemes towards conservation-driven farming [@asheimPolicyMeasuresPreserve2020]. Infields and outfields could be used as familiar, culturally-rooted references, which are associated to concrete management practices and provide a fair appreciation of the current ecological synergies and trade-offs across farming systems. Several knowledge gaps have however yet to be thoroughly addressed, especially regarding the biotic-abiotic interactions in the soil system which drive the response of soil fauna to land use changes [@geisenMethodologicalFrameworkEmbrace2019]. The Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve opens the door for holistic, trans-disciplinary approaches that should pave the way towards sustainable agriculture ensuring both the viability of farming activity and the preservation of multifunctional landscapes [@cusensSocioculturalValuesBiophysical2024].
