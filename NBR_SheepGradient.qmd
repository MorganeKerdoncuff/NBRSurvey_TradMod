# ABSTRACT

# INTRODUCTION

Since the first forest clearings by fire [@prosch-danielsenPalaeoecologicalInvestigationsReconstruction2000], humans have ensured their self-subsistence by transforming nature with a wide range of agricultural practices adapted to the environmental constraints [@ellisLandUseEcological2021; @plieningerTraditionalLanduseNature2006]. To overcome the discrepancy of resources, farmer communities across very different ecosystems have resorted to remarkably similar strategies based on complementary crop and animal husbandry systems: livestock grazing on low-productive areas provides manure for the edible crops grown on more productive fields, while the crop residues can be recycled as mulch or animal feed [@christiansenInfieldoutfieldSystemsCharacteristics1978; @sekaranRoleIntegratedCroplivestock2021; @yangResearchTrendsCrop2022]. These endogenous transfers of energy and nutrients allowed an extensive use of the land while simultaneously shaping heterogeneous landscapes supporting a high level of biodiversity and the resilience of the whole agro-ecological system [@altieriLinkingEcologistsTraditional2004; @kremenLandscapesThatWork2018; @tscharntkeOrganicFarmingHarnessing2021]. However these management practices have drastically declined after the Green Revolution [@ramankuttyTrendsGlobalAgricultural2018], with on one hand the introduction of fertiliser and machinery leading to over-intensification of productive lands [@billenReshapingEuropeanAgrofood2021; (+)] and on the other the gradual abandonment of more remote and less productive areas [@reybenayasAbandonmentAgriculturalLand2007; @xieConservationOpportunitiesUncontested2019]. It resulted into severe loss and degradation of semi-natural habitats along with wide-scale homogenisation of the agricultural landscapes, dramatically affecting local and global biodiversity [@beckmannConventionalLandUse2019; @flynnLossFunctionalDiversity2009; @newboldGlobalEffectsLand2015] and associated ecosystem functions [@allanLandUseIntensification2015; @isbellNutrientEnrichmentBiodiversity2013] and services [@foleyGlobalConsequencesLand2005; @kwonGlobalEstimatesImpacts2016]. In the face of these dramatic consequences, the dominant paradigm has been progressively shifting towards more sustainable land use and food production that would preserve both natural resources and local communities well-being [@douwevanderploegPeasantriesTwentyfirstCentury2010; @garibaldiFarmingApproachesGreater2017].

- Learning from the past to build the future - coming back to "traditional" agricultural practices is a wishful thinking and non desirable, but understanding the ecological dynamics underlying the functioning 
- but examining agricultural systems and practices inherited from long-term management 

In Western Norway, the agro-ecological landscape has been safeguarded from severe land use changes [@dramstadTenancyNorwegianAgriculture2010; @fjellstadPatternsChangeTwo1999] mainly because of the limiting landform and climatic regime of the fjord system that have constrained human activity since the first settlers [@ketzlerClimateNorway2021; @nesjeFjordsNorwayComplex2009]. Farmer-fisher communities used to rely on crop-livestock systems, referred to in Nordic countries as infield-outfield systems [@christiansenInfieldoutfieldSystemsCharacteristics1978], involving systemic transhumance and rotational management to maximise the land use potential along the whole coast-to-moutain gradient [@austadHumaninfluencedVegetationTypes1991; @hjelleHesitantHuntersReview2006; @olssonAgroecosystemsNeolithicTime1991]. Atlantic wet heathland on the flat, notched coastal area would be regularly rejuvenated with rotational prescribed burning to provide more palatable fodder for year-round grazing animals [@thorvaldsenGammalnorskSauOg2017; @vandvikManagementdrivenEvolutionDomesticated2014], and heath also used to be scythed for both hay and domestic use [@lundbergAustevollChangingCoastal1991]. In mountain areas, subalpine heathlands would be used for sheep and goat summer farming, not only allowing temporary rest for grazing fields in the lowlands but also providing direct incomes through cheese production [@olssonLandscapeChangePatterns2000; @potthoffChangeMountainSummer2004]. In-between the least productive areas designated as outfields (*utmark*) [@lillehammerPresentLandscapePerception2007], the large intermediate stretch of more productive lands would see the development of pluriactive farms encompassing arable lands, grazing fields, hay-meadows and woodlands within a finely grained landscape mosaic of high ecological and cultural values [@haugeGaldaneLaerdalWestern1988; @hetlandPluriactivityStrategyEmployment1986; @olssonAgroecosystemsNeolithicTime1991]. The productivism trend emerging after WWII led to the rationalisation of livestock production, with a shift of grazing animals to fertilised infields (*innmark*) and a subsequent increase of farm size [@dramstadTenancyNorwegianAgriculture2010; @forbordDriversChangeNorwegian2014; @jonesLandtenureLandscapeChange1988]. On the other hand remote outfields were gradually abandoned [@fjellstadPatternsChangeTwo1999; @hamreLandcoverStructuralChanges2007a], causing the joint loss of cultural knowledge and ecological diversity associated with traditional management practices of hay-meadows [@norderhaugBiotopePatternsAbundance2000; @wehnAdaptiveBiodiversityManagement2018], coastal heathlands [@lundbergAustevollChangingCoastal1991; @webbTraditionalManagementEuropean1998] and mountain summer farms [@noelEffectsAbandonmentAlpine2010; @olssonLandscapeChangePatterns2000]. The deep and lasting socio-economic decline of the countryside that followed has made particularly challenging any policy attempt to halt the widespread land abandonment process, let alone reverse it [@blekesauneAgricultureImportanceViability1999; @daugstadAgricultureUpholderCultural2006; @forbordDriversChangeNorwegian2014].

- In this context, the nature's contributions to people (NCP) framework [@diazAssessingNatureContributions2018], more inclusive update of the ecosystem services [@ellisEcosystemServicesNature2019; @haines-youngCommonInternationalClassification2018], offers a useful toolbox for decision-making as it provides 1) intuitive methodology for participatory approaches [@cusensParticipatoryMappingReveals2022], 2) theoretical support for policy-oriented concepts such as multifunctionality [@bjorkhaugMultifunctionalAgriculturePolicy2008; @wilsonWeakStrongMultifunctionality2008] and 3) quantitative assessments of the direct and indirect benefits provided by the farmers or land managers [@bernuesSeeingNorthernEuropean2016].
- Examining the services supplied by semi-natural habitats beyond the productivity would facilitate the engagement and planning of conservation measures by highlighting the value of fertile areas and identifying trade-offs across the whole agro-ecological system [@geertsemaActionableKnowledgeEcological2016; @germanRelationshipsMultipleAspects2017].

- As such, habitat productivity is in balance with diversity and nutrient cycling

- The most examined trade-off is the productivity-diversity: the dominance of palatable species with high nutritional quality for the livestock comes at the expense of less competitive species
- productivity-diversity balance driven by both competition processes and tolerance to grazing, which will favour the dominance of more competitive and palatable species and thus reduce the overall species richness, indirectly impacting other services (e.g. pollination).


- Building from/relying on the infield-outfield systems, competing functions can be expected
- The infield/outfield classification would make interesting starting point as it clearly discriminates habitats according to their inherent productivity 

- However, even if agricultural habitats were shaped for the main purpose of livestock herding, as a consequence the habitats fulfilled a whole range of other services, including: nectar supply for the the pollinators, carbon storage in the soil for climate mitigation or appreciation of landscape aesthetics supported by biodiversity and fundamental ecosystem functions.
- Thus this productivity can come at the expense of other service -> trade-offs
- For instance the nutrient cycling process between aboveground and belowground compartment: it rate/speed will be determined by nutrient availability (soil condition, available litter) and the functional diversity & abundance of decomposer communities and will define the main supporting role of the habitat, with slow cycle engaging low productivity but carbon storage (e.g. wetland) while fast cycle will trigger high productivity but lower storage.

- understanding ES trade-offs & synergies as necessary prerequisite for sustainable food production @geertsemaActionableKnowledgeEcological2016
- particularly in stressed environments, trade-offs could be expected between short-term plant digestibility and long-term preservation of nutrient pools in the soil [@niuTradeoffsForageQuality2016]
- existing trade-offs between productivity and services & biodiversity, but evidence for lowering in favour to dominant synergies if context-specific and bottom-up approaches @germanRelationshipsMultipleAspects2017
- trade-off milk production & ecological diversity in mountains [@farruggiaAnimalPerformancesPasture2014]
- [chunk description different steps & factors of influence]
- as grazing effects interact with environmental gradient [@fynnManagingBrowsingGrazing2019] and habitat productivity [@mcnaughtonEcosystemlevelPatternsPrimary1989], it would be interesting to explore the balance between these different functions according to field types and across the fjord gradient [if secondary analysis relying on temp/precipitation gradient]
- Reference study which looked at plant functional type diversity (alpha, beta, gamma) across elevational gradient in Western Norway [@austrheimPlantDiversityPatterns2002].

- herbivore effect on plant species richness depends on site productivity -> (+) high vs (-) low [@bakkerHerbivoreImpactGrassland2006]
- grazing x productivity [@pakemanConsistencyPlantSpecies2004]

## AIM/HYP

<!-- - In Western Norway, the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve showcases in a nutshell the socio-ecological features and historical trends of a -->
<!-- - The recently designated NBR would be a helpful lever to engage different parties into dialogue and solutioning -->
<!-- - Expand scientific knowledge on these habitat dynamic would therefore be helpful in that regard -->

- Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve = Western Norway in a nutshell + optimal framework to levering decision-making
- We relied on the following triptych: diversity, production, soil nutrient recycling
- Relying on the infield/outfield dichotomy which discriminates habitats according to their productivity
- We expect the fields to aggregate according to two main subgroups representing infields and outfields respectively, and we expect a form of complementarity between these two groups. 
- The main factor of difference should be woody biomass, which should be dominant in outfields and negligible in infields.
- Outfields are also expected to have a higher bryophyte diversity but a lower forb diversity.
- Infields should have higher monocotyledon biomass and faster energy cycle, thus a lower carbon stock in the soil.
- However we expect these two groups to be heterogeneous due to the diversity of both ecological context and farming practices, and these lower divisions are what we are most interested about.

# MATERIAL AND METHODS

## Study area

The Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve (NBR) encompasses in a nutshell the main features of the fjord system in Western Norway [@kalandNordhordlandBiosphereReserve2018]: the sharp elevation gradient creates a tight transition between the mild, oceanic regime on the west and the alpine regime on the east with decreasing temperatures and increasing precipitations [@ketzlerClimateNorway2021]. Between the coast and the mountains, mean annual precipitation can vary up to twice as much (from 1550 to 4800 mm) and mean July temperature can drop by almost half (from 15.9 to 8.3°C), along with increasing annual temperature range [@meteorologiskinstituttNorskKlimaservicesenter2023]. The region can thus be coarsely divided into three main ecological zones (adapted from @uttakleivLandskapskartleggingNorge2011): the coastal area, mostly made of flat islets and peninsulas, which have been used for both outfields and infields; the fjord area, characterised by productive infields in the valleys while the sharp slopes are covered by forests; the mountain area, up to 1300 masl, essentially used for summer outfields.

In summer 2019 and 2020. we conducted an ecological survey on 23 grazing fields spread along the whole elevation gradient of the NBR, with 11 infields in the coastal and fjord areas and 12 outfields mainly located in the coastal and mountain areas (@fig-sitemap). The sites were selected according to the Norwegian "areal type" AR5 classification system [@ahlstromAR5Klassifikasjonssystem2019], which defines infields (*innmarksbeite*) as "*agricultural lands that cannot be harvested mechanically* \[with\] *at least 50% of the area* \[...\] *covered with cultured grass or pasture-tolerant herbs*". There is no specific areal category for outfields, but they were located on "open permanent lands" (*åpen fastmark*) which are described as "*areas that are neither a bog, agricultural, forest or infrastructure*". Information on the sites management were collected from phone interviews with farmers, conducted from October 2021 to January 2022.

Coastal outfields (under 150 masl) were *Calluna vulgaris* dominated heathlands, grazed all year round by rustic sheep breeds such as the Norwegian old sheep (*Gammel Norsk Sau*) or the Cheviot sheep from Scotland (*Sjeviotsau*). Three of them were still managed with rotational prescribed burning and showed different stages of heath regeneration. The only outfield visited in the fjord area and the resulted from a former forest clearing and was dominated by *Vaccinium myrtillus* and *Galium saxatile*. In the mountain area, outfields were large areas that could be grazed by several sheep flocks from both the rustic breeds and the conventional Norwegian white sheep (*Norsk Kvit Sau*) for at most 4 months during the summer season. Our sites were located between 600 and 875 masl and dominated by ericaceous shrubs (*Vaccinium* spp) with a well-developed bryophyte layer. Infields were permanent grasslands (under 200 masl) dominated by *Agrostis capillaris*-*Poa pratensis* assemblages in the more productive sites and by *Festuca rubra* in less productive areas. In both cases the layer of creeping vegetation was well-represented, with species such as *Galium saxatile* and *Potentilla erecta*. The management was highly variable between farms: the fields were grazed from 3 to 12 months with both rustic and conventional breeds and 7 out of 11 sites were enriched with either artificial fertiliser, manure and/or shell/sand-lime mix.

## Data collection

We visited each field once between mid-June and mid-August according to the "spring" bloom occurring first in the coastal area and in the late season in the mountain area. The sampling area was when possible a 20 x 20 m square, if not a 40 x 10 m stripe, representative of the surrounding vegetation and avoiding rocks, waterlogged ground, trees and field edges. We nested three plots of 3 x 3 m separated by at least 6 m from each other and themselves divided into nine quadrats of 1 m^2^. Five quadrats were dedicated to the non-destructive inventory of plant species and the remaining four quadrats were used for biomass and/or soil sampling (@fig-sampling).

All vascular plants and bryophyte species within each non-destructive quadrat were identified to the species level and attributed a percent of abundance-cover by one of the same two observers (15 replicates per site). When possible, vascular plants were identified with the Nordic flora [@mossbergGyldendalsStoreNordiske2018] on site. Non-identified species, including all bryophytes, were collected and brought to expert identification. Aboveground standing biomass was collected in a 0.5 x 0.5 m^2^ quadrat once per plot (3 replicates per site) by cutting vegetation as close to the ground as possible while avoiding the litter. The samples were stored in the freezer (-20°C) before processing. We sorted the standing vegetation into woody, vascular and cryptogams and weighted the dry biomass after 48h in the oven at 65°C. We sampled soil with a stainless steel cylindrical core of 200 cm^3^ (diam. 10.5 cm; height 12 cm) in each destructive quadrat and stored it at 9°C before lab processing. For each plot, one core out of four (3 replicates per site) was used for Berlese-Tullgren extraction of mesofauna [@tullgrenSehrEinfacherAusleseapparat1918], with aluminium funnels of 62 cm height, 33.5 cm top diameter and 5.3 cm exit diameter. The soil was kept under heating lamps (50 W) for 96 hours on 2 cm mesh size grids at a distance of approximately 40 cm from the bulb to allow the surface to slowly dry. The extracted samples were stored in 70% ethanol for sorting and counting of acari and collembola. The three remaining soil cores were sieved and merged at the plot level (3 replicates per site) for the determination of loss of ignition in a certified analysis laboratory.

## Data analysis

All statistical and ordination analyses were performed on R (v.4.3.0) with R-Studio (v.2023.03.1+446) [@rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2023]. We used the *vegan* package [@oksanenVeganCommunityEcology2022] for clustering projection on ordination space. All data except plant species richness were summarized at the site level by average.

Species richness was estimated for each plant functional group, namely woody, vascular and cryptogams, at the scale of the site by integrating all species collected across the 15 quadrats.

All our variables were scaled prior to analysis to account for unit differences. We performed hierarchical clustering with Ward's criterion which squares the dissimilarities before clustering [@murtaghWardHierarchicalAgglomerative2014]. We chose Euclidean distance to calculate dissimilarities between our variables, which were all continuous and quantitative [**ref**]. As we ran this analysis for an exploratory purpose, we chose arbitrarily a number of clusters beyond the expected major infield/outfield dichotomy, while still aiming for compact clusters of equivalent sizes. We projected our clusters on ordination space with Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) [**ref**] to verify for their consistency and orientation. We compared individual variable distribution between clusters with the Dunn's Kruskal-Wallis test of multiple pairwise comparisons, with family-wise error rate addressed with Bonferroni adjustment [@dunnMultipleComparisonsMeans1961; @dunnMultipleComparisonsUsing1964; @kruskalUseRanksOneCriterion1952].



# RESULTS

We registered a total of `r totplantsp` plant species, among which `r nrow(totforbsp)` forbs, `r nrow(totmonocsp)` monocotyledons, `r nrow(totbryosp)` bryophytes, including mosses and liverworts, and `r nrow(totwoodysp)` shrubs and woody species. We also collected a total of `r totacari` acari and `r totcollem` collembola across all sites.

:::

As expected, the sites aggregated into two main groups representing outfields (pink gradient) and infields (orange gradient) respectively, with two seemingly outlying infields (IN10, IN11) and one outfield (CO3) arranged with the other field type (@fig-clustertree). Both groups showed dominant clusters of seven sites, namely C3 for infields and C4 for outfields, with the former being substantially tighter in ordination space compared with the latter (@fig-clusterord). All remaining clusters, two for the outfield group and one for the infield group, were only made of either two or three scattered sites.

![Comparison of decomposition, diversity and productivity variables between primary clusters (A) and between secondary clusters from the same division (B and C). For primary clusters A and B and secondary clusters 2 and 3 we used unpaired non-parametric Mann-Whitney tests. For secondary clusters 1, 4 and 5, we used non-parametric Kruskall-Wallis tests followed by pairwise comparison Dunn's tests, with significantly different pair indicated in brackets when applicable. Significance levels are: ° for p-value < 0.1; * for p-value < 0.05; ** for p-value < 0.01; *** for p-value < 0.001](outputs/clusterplot_all.png){#fig-clusterplots}

When comparing the dominant clusters of each group (C3 and C4), outfields had on average higher LOI (mean~CA~ = `r filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 1)$LOI_mean`, sd~CA~ = `r filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 1)$LOI_sd`; mean~CB~ = `r filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 2)$LOI_mean`, sd~CB~ = `r filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 2)$LOI_sd`), higher diversity of cryptogams (mean~CA~ = `r filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 1)$div_cryptogams_mean`, sd~CA~ = `r filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 1)$div_cryptogams_sd`; mean~CB~ = `r filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 2)$div_cryptogams_mean`, sd~CB~ = `r filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 2)$div_cryptogams_sd`) and woody (mean~CA~ = `r filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 1)$div_woody_mean`, sd~CA~ = `r filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 1)$div_woody_sd`; mean~CB~ = `r filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 2)$div_woody_mean`, sd~CB~ = `r filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 2)$div_woody_sd`) species, and lower diversity of forbs (mean~CA~ = `r filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 1)$div_forbs_mean`, sd~CA~ = `r filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 1)$div_forbs_sd`; mean~CB~ = `r filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 2)$div_forbs_mean`, sd~CB~ = `r filter(sheep_summary_prim, cluster_prim == 2)$div_forbs_sd`) compared with infields (@fig-clusterplots). 

Within the infield group, C2 and C3 showed very similar diversity patterns but the former had a significantly higher abundance of acari (mean~C2~ = `r filter(sheep_summary_sec, cluster_sec == 2)$ab_acari_mean`, sd~C2~ = `r filter(sheep_summary_sec, cluster_sec == 2)$ab_acari_sd`) compared with the latter (mean~C3~ = `r filter(sheep_summary_sec, cluster_sec == 3)$ab_acari_mean`, sd~C3~ = `r filter(sheep_summary_sec, cluster_sec == 3)$ab_acari_sd`). Within the outfield group, there was no significant differences between the three clusters, but we could nevertheless observe a seemingly higher woody biomass for C1 and highest diversity across all plant functional groups for C5 (@fig-clusterplots).

# DISCUSSION

## Main results

- Expectations verified as the type of field the main aggregative factor
  - Outfields with higher woody and cryptogtam diversity
  - Infields with faster nutrient cycle and higher forb diversity
  - However infields did not have higher monocotyledon biomass compared with outfields
- Overall, infields more "homogeneous" than outfields
- Functional group diversity overall related to phosphorus gradient, apart monocotyledons
- LOI related to phosphorus concentration -> confirm faster nutrient cycles in infields
- Investigated gradients did not show as appropriate predictors of plant aboveground biomass or mesofauna abundance

## Diversity

- increase cattle density decreases legumes species diversity through increase bare soil (trampling), but increase non-legumes forbs [@buzhdyganDirectIndirectEffects2020]
- in upland areas, overall decrease in species richness over time for both grazed and ungrazed treatments, usually associated with decrease of cryptogam species [@aldayEffectsLongtermRemoval2021]
- biodiversity impoverishment in upland areas mostly regarding abundance of lichens and liverworts despite change in management practices [@milliganWinnersLosersLongterm2016]
- main determinants of vascular species richness: soil moisture > pH > phosphorus; & main determinants of bryophyte species richness: soil moisture > organic matter [@merunkovaEnvironmentalControlSpecies2012]

## Productivity

- effect of grazing intensity on grass, forb & shrub production depends on temperature & precipitation during growing season [@pattonEffectsGrazingIntensity2007]
- effect of grazing intensity on taxonomical & functional diversity stronger in dryer environments @carmonaTaxonomicalFunctionalDiversity2012
- different grazing capacities depending on the habitat type as it is limited by available biomass in nutrient-rich habitats and by nutrient content in nutrient-poor habitats [@gilhausSeasonalVariationsFodder2016]
- response of plant species richness to grazing primarily driven by herbivory-induced changes in community dominance instead of productivity gradient [@koernerChangeDominanceDetermines2018]
- stability of aboveground biomass production in Tibetan alpine meadows correlated with high-palatability herbage stability, which AGB is stimulated by rotational grazing against exclusion, & asynchrony between high & low palatability [@liRotationalGrazingPromotes2020] -> importance of maintaining grazing in upland systems

## Elevation gradient

- direct increase species richness with elevation, but indirect negative effect through decrease soil pH & subsequent decrease earthworms biomass [@buzhdyganDirectIndirectEffects2020]
- use of grazing resources by sheep following an elevation gradient [@mysterudEffectsDensitySeason2007]
- effect bryophyte cover on alpine microclimate @jaroszynskaBryophytesDominatePlant2023
- elevation significantly affected plant Shannon, functional dispersion & evenness but not functional richness in sub-alpine & alpine meadows [@komacFunctionalDiversityGrazing2015]

## Outfields vs infields

- sheep feeding behaviour (e.g. bite rate) different according to habitat (grass vs heather) type [@hesterForagingBehaviourSheep1999]

## Study limitations

- biomass in itself not perfect proxy of nutritive feeding for animals, as chemical composition & plant strategy also affected by climatic gradient -> more defence mechanisms, thus less efficient energy & nutrient uptake under high precipitations conditions [@hopcraftHerbivoresResourcesRisks2010]
- trade-off grazing intensity with forage quality & animal performance in upland (420 masl) meadows [@pavluEffectContinuousGrazing2006]

- time window very small, and potentially not able to capture processes of either biomass production, where rate over year more appropriate than static measurement [@brownImportanceScaleEvaluating1989], and soil fauna activity [**ref from soil course**]
- effect of grazing intensity on biomass production & interaction with temperature & precipitations varied according to time of sampling within grazing season [@pattonEffectsGrazingIntensity2007] -> we did not have control of the timing when the animals where put into the field

## Perspectives

- heaths in uplands very important for biodiversity conservation - carabid species [@eyreRelationshipBritishGround2003]
- trade-off - increase grazing intensity does not always increase productivity, as light & moderate grazing usually maximise fodder production [@pattonEffectsGrazingIntensity2007]
- small-scale farming more likely to have sharper shifts along the multifunctionality gradient due to a narrower range of opportunities, while transition has more chance to be more gradual on large capitalised farms [@wilsonWeakStrongMultifunctionality2008]
- positive relationship between biodiversity and multifunctionality up to a certain level of redundancy which potentially varies according to local conditions [@hectorBiodiversityEcosystemMultifunctionality2007]
- challenge to preserve habitat quality and diversity in areas where farming/management is not anymore economically viable [@kohlerChangesSpeciesComposition2005]
- purpose of rotation & transhumance: to optimise the use of habitats of different productivity, with digestibility & nutrient highest earlier (spring & summer) in nutrient-rich habitats and later (summer & fall) in nutrient-poor habitats [@gilhausSeasonalVariationsFodder2016]
- maintaining grazing in upland areas would ensure plant community stability & preservation plant species richness over time [@speedResponsePlantDiversity2013]
- infield-outfield strategy regaining popularity for control over the N cycle in agriculture by limiting import and leakages [@billenReshapingEuropeanAgrofood2021]
