# ABSTRACT

# INTRODUCTION

# MATERIAL AND METHODS

## Study area

The UNESCO Nordhordland Biosphere Reserve is located in Western Norway. 
Its main geomorphological feature is the fjord landscape, the deepest arm reaching x km inland. 
The climate is oceanic, characterized by mild temperature (mean January, mean June) and high precipitation level (). 
There are both temperature and precipitation west-east gradients [@kalandNordhordlandBiopshereReserve2018]. 
The coastal region buffers the climate seasonal cycle while temperature annual variation increases inland. 
The precipitation gradient is greatly affected by the topography: the mean annual precipitation is twice as much in higher elevation compared to the flat coastal areas.

## Study sites

We sampled 30 grassland fields across the municipalities of Alver and Austrheim (@fig-sitemap).
