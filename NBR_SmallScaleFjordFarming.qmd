# ABSTRACT

We aimed to present an exploratory study of the ecological interactions between grassland communities of dominant grasses, forbs and beetles, and sets of environmental factors which characterize low-intensity farming in Norwegian fjord across scales. We used canonical correlation analysis to determine linear correlations between sets of explanatory and community variables.


# INTRODUCTION

Conventional agriculture leaning back against globalized food chain has reached its limits. The literature pool assessing the global impact of intensive farming on nature including habitat loss and fragmentation [@jongmanHomogenisationFragmentationEuropean2002], soil erosion and depletion [**REF**], freshwater pollution through nutrient leaching [REF], and biodiversity loss [@beckmannConventionalLandUse2019; @newboldGlobalEffectsLand2015; @kleijnRelationshipFarmlandBiodiversity2009] with subsequent erosion of ecosystem functions and services [@jeanneretIncreaseFoodProduction2021; @flynnLossFunctionalDiversity2009], has been growing relentlessly for the past 20 years and has made fertile ground for alarming predictions if business-as-usual was to continue over the rest of the century [@hunterAgriculture2050Recalibrating2017; @foleySolutionsCultivatedPlanet2011; @egliWinnersLosersNational2018]. At the European scale, if the Green Revolution did substantially increased food security over the second half of the XX^th^ century, the current degraded state of agricultural lands is rather forecasting stagnation if not decline of productivity potential for the coming decades [@jongmanHomogenisationFragmentationEuropean2002; @haladaWhichHabitatsEuropean2011; @vosTrendsEuropeanCultural1999]. Following the repeated calls for a sustainable transition of agriculture, a regained interest has grown towards small-scale traditional grazing systems [@plieningerTraditionalLanduseNature2006; @torokGrazingEuropeanOpen2016; @garibaldiFarmingApproachesGreater2017; @cunninghamCloseYieldgapSaving2013], which drive local community autonomy and support biodiversity of high value [@bignalLowIntensityFarmingSystems1996; @altieriLinkingEcologistsTraditional2004]. Conventional and traditional agricultures rely on fundamentally different approaches of natural resources management [@bignalLowIntensityFarmingSystems1996; @vosTrendsEuropeanCultural1999]. Conventional farming is driven by objectives of performance and efficiency on the short-term. It aims to maximise the production by overcoming environmental constraints through the use of machinery and agrochemistry, resulting in homogenisation of landscapes and practices [@jongmanHomogenisationFragmentationEuropean2002]. On the other hand, traditional small-scale farming has developed to adapt to the local environment, with diversified practices and limitation of inputs. This strategy prioritises long term preservation of the natural capital over immediate production and enhances both the heterogeneity and the resilience of the agroecosystem [@gardnerAgriculturalResiliencePerspectives2019; @menconiRevisitingGlobalFood2022]. 
<!-- Less emphasized is the impact of the agroindustrial model and trade on the people standing at the frontline of the chain, namely the farmers. While they should be among the most influential apparatus regarding land use and natural resources management, they find themselves at the bottom of the decision-making process, subdued to the versatility of the market and competing with fellow farmers at the other side of the globe [@gimenezAgroecologyFoodSovereignty2012]. -->

By its adaptative and selective nature, traditional farming is more difficult to standardise compared with conventional practices, and thus would require an extensive effort of research across ecosystem types to apprehend the whole spectrum of strategies, how they influence the habitat dynamic and how they cope with environmental feedback [@altieriLinkingEcologistsTraditional2004; @cunninghamCloseYieldgapSaving2013]. A well-suited framework for this task would be the UNESCO World Network of Biosphere Reserves [@unescoNewRoadmapMan2017]. Biosphere reserves are model area for the regional experimentation and implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals [@unitednationsTransformingOurWorld2015], and the world network offers a platform for international collaboration and knowledge-sharing. The UNESCO Nordhordland Biosphere Reserve captures a good picture of small-scale grazing systems in Western Norway. The main geomorphological feature of the region is the fjord system. Remnant scars from the last glaciation, fjords are deep sea arms which dive up to 200 km inland. From the induced topographical and climatic gradients which has shaped human activity, and thus management history, results a mosaic-like landscape, where individual farms encompass different types of land use according to edaphic conditions and habitat productivity [**REF**]. Typical farming in Western Norway involves rotational grazing management, with low stocking density and different types of livestock including cows, sheep and goats [**REF**]. If these practices have shown to enhance biodiversity and increase the field productivity in experiments [@boavistaEffectsGrazingRegimes2019; @skornikEffectGrazingPressure2010], what would be their actual effects on managed grasslands when integrated within the complexily intertwined network of interactions cascading from the fjord system [*yes the end of the sentence is a bit thick*]?

Several studies have tried to hierarchise the cross-scale influence of environmental and anthropogenic factors on species richness [@billeterIndicatorsBiodiversityAgricultural2007; @habelEuropeanGrasslandEcosystems2013; @turtureanuScaleTaxondependentBiodiversity2014; @zulkaSpeciesRichnessDry2014]. Considerably less attention was given to community composition when it was not related to conservation perspectives on rare species [@gonthierBiodiversityConservationAgriculture2014, but see @zelnikPlantSpeciesDiversity2013]. 

- Yet, the dominant assemblages of plants and arthropods will drive the functionality of the system. 
- In grasslands, the most important feature/service for the farmer is the site productivity. 
- The dominant grasses should provide good forage for the livestock, the dominant forbs should assist either by enriching the soil (leguminous) or by providing complementary nutrients. 
- The beetle assemblage should be dominated by groups which are specialised in dung-recycling.

[*should be the abstract bit*] We aimed to present an exploratory study of the ecological interactions between grassland communities of dominant grasses, forbs and beetles, and sets of environmental factors which characterize small-scale farming in Norwegian fjord across scales.

# MATERIAL AND METHODS

## Study area

The UNESCO Nordhordland Biosphere Reserve (NBR) is located in Western Norway. Its main geomorphological feature is the fjord landscape, the deepest arm reaching 205 km inland. The climate is oceanic, characterized by mild temperature (**mean January, mean June**) and high precipitation level (between 1300 and 3000 mm annually). There are both temperature and precipitation west-east gradients [@kalandNordhordlandBiopshereReserve2018]. The coastal region buffers the climate seasonal cycle while temperature annual variation increases inland. The precipitation gradient is greatly affected by the topography: the mean annual precipitation is twice as much in higher elevation compared to the flat coastal areas.

## Study sites

We sampled 29 grassland fields across the Southern part of the NBR (@fig-sitemap).

```

Sites were either grazed by sheep, goats or cows for at least the past 5 years, and have been under grazing management for at least the past decade. Grasslands were chosen to be representative of small-scale farming system in Western Norway, with low-intensity grazing and limited amount of inputs. To the knowledge of the current farmers, no field was resown and/or plowed since the 1970s. Four sites were drained between 1990 and 2010 (OS1, IC1, OS4, OC3). The different treatments applied to the fields (grazing excluded) are described in Appendix (@tbl-farmermanagement).

## Conceptual framework

The potential drivers of the plant and beetle community were divided into 4 categories regarding their scale of influence and their relationship with human activity. We first present a summary (@fig-fjordconcept) before describing each set of variables with more details:

-   the **fjord system** encompasses all geomorphological and climatic features which influence the landscape and are independent of any human influence.
-   the **landscape matrix** gathers the different land covers and uses which surround the field within 1 km2 radius. It is both dependent of the topography and the human activity (forestry, crops, grazing, infrastructures...).
-   the **grazing management** relates to the livestock breeding and to the structure of infield area of the farm. It is likely to be influenced by the landscape topography and the types of available habitats around the farm.
-   the **fine-scale environment** at the sampling area level represents all the ecological parameters which can directly or indirectly influence the local niches. These drivers will be affected by all factors occurring at wider scale.

## Data collection

*For Amy and Inger: a sketch of the sampling design will obviously come*

### Sampling set-up

Ecological data were collected in June and July 2019 and 2020. A sampling area of 20 x 20 m^2^ which was representative of the grazing field was defined on each site. Field edges, wet zones and exposed rocks were avoided. Three plots of 3 x 3 m^2^ were set within the sampling area, with a distance of at least 6 m between each other. The plots were divided into 9 quadrats of 1 m^2^ which were split into two groups, one for non-destructive measurements (5 quadrats) and one for destructive measurements (4 quadrats). All samples from one site except beetles were collected the same day.

### Plant community data

Plant species and percent cover were collected on non-destructive quadrats, for a total of 15 quadrats per site. The identifications were made with the Nordic flora [@mossbergGyldendalsStoreNordiske2018] by the two same observers for both years. For each quadrat, the percent cover of the different functional groups and the vegetation mean height were also estimated.

### Beetle community data

Beetle specimens were collected with dung-baited pitfall traps located on the destructive quadrats, for a total of 12 pitfall traps per site. The traps were made of white plastic cups of 1 L (diam. 10.5 cm; height 11.5 cm) filled to 1/4 with salted water and a drop of neutral detergent to break water surface tension [REF]. The traps were set into the ground with the edge at the same level as the soil surface and covered with a metal grid with a 2 x 2 cm mesh size. A ball of cow dung, previously frozen, was then placed on the middle of the grid roof in a way that it would leave at least 3 cm of empty space around the edge of the cups for the beetles to fall in. The traps were left on site for one full week before retrieval. Beetles were stored in 70% ethanol and sorted into families in the lab using @duffBeetlesBritainIreland2012b.

### Soil compaction data

All data collection related to soil physical properties was done in destructive quadrats.

We measured the penetration rate with a sharpened metal rod of 43.4 cm (diam. 2.2 cm; weight [**?**]) that we dropped vertically from 1 m above ground and through a plastic tube to ensure the stick direction. The visible standing part of the stick was measured and subtracted from the total stick length to obtain the length of penetration into the soil. We performed two penetration tests per quadrat, one on each upper corner (**FIG**), for a total of 24 tests per site. The tip was regularly sharpened and its length remeasured across the field season. The difference in length between the start and the end of the two sampling seasons was 0.7 cm

We sampled three soil cores of 57.23 cm^3^ (diam. 3.7 cm; height 10 cm) in each quadrat for the measure of the bulk density and the soil moisture. Cores were made of PVC tubes which edges have been sharpened. Prior to sinking the cores into the soil with a light hammer, the surrounding root mat was cut with a knife to limit soil disturbance during the sampling. Cores were covered with plastic foil and stored at 6.C before processing in the lab. The soil volume of each core was corrected for holes or unfilled space if necessary prior to weight measurements. We weighted the cores before and after drying in oven at 105.C, and calculated the bulk density and the percent soil moisture as following:
$$
\text{Bulk density }(g/cm^3) = \frac{\text{Core dry weight (g)}}{\text{Core volume }(cm^3)}
$$.

$$
\text{Soil moisture}\text{ (%)} = \frac{\text{Core dry weight (g)}}{\text{Core fresh weight (g)}}
$$.

Bulk density and soil moisture data needed some adjustments due to field and lab constraints. When field sampling was poorly performed because of high root density, high sand rate or steep slope, the core volume actually filled with soil could be very low. Bulk density estimation being less accurate on low soil volumes, we discarded cores with an estimated volume of soil under 50 cm^3^. A weighing scale dysfunction issue also affected some of our samples during lab processing, therefore negative or extreme values were removed. After data filtering, all sites had between 9 and 36 sample replicates.

### Soil chemistry data

We collected a supplementary soil core in each destructive quadrat for chemical analyses, for a total of 12 cores per site. We used a stainless steel cylindrical core of 200 cm^3^ (diam. 10.5 cm; height 12 cm) which was dug into the ground by rotational movements. The soil was stored at 4.C before lab processing. Cores were sieved and merged at the plot level, and 0.5 L was sent to a certified analysis laboratory for nitrogen and phosphorus quantitative analyses. Total nitrogen content and available phosphorus were determined by using modified Kjeldahl method (NS-EN 13654-1:2890) [@bremnerDeterminationNitrogenSoil1960] and ammonium lactate extraction method [@brayDeterminationTotalOrganic1945] respectively.

### Topographical data

We recorded field slope angle on site with a compass clinometer, with the observer standing at the highest point and looking down to another observer standing at the lowest point. The mean elevation and the sites coordinates were also collected on the field with a GPS. The aspect degree of the site was determined from geospatial data. An aspect map in degree azimuth of the whole NBR region was generated in QGIS (version 3.12.2) from a Digital Elevation Model with cell size of 10 x 10 m collected on GeoNorge (https://kartkatalog.geonorge.no). The distance between sites and closest sea or fjord bodies was geospatially measured on the map Norge i bilder (https://norgeibilder.no/).

### Landscape data

We collected land cover data on the natural information map Kilden (https://kilden.nibio.no) provided by the Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy (NiBIO). Proportions of land cover were retrieved for a buffer zone of 1 km^2^ radius around each field. We simplified the area classification by merging some of the categories to limit our number of variables. The final classification encompassed the following categories: forest area, including managed and non-managed; cultivated area, including fully and partially; infield area; outfield area; wetland area.

### Climate data

Average annual precipitations, July maximum temperatures and January minimum temperatures were calculated from 1 km^2^ daily projections provided by the Norwegian Centre for Climate Services over the period 2010-2020 [@wongGriddedKmClimate2016]. For sites non covered by the grid, values were determined from neighbourhood calculation with the R package *terra* (v. 1.7.29) [@hijmansTerraSpatialData2023].

### Field management data

Information on the grazing management of each field were collected from the farmers with phone interviews conducted from October 2021 to January 2022. Three farmers could not or did not want to reply to our survey. We completed the missing values with data from a similar interview series conducted in 2018 [@reiersenBaerekraftVestnorskLandbruk2019]. We asked the farmers for the following elements: the type of livestock (cow, sheep or goat) which has been grazing the site for at least the past 5 years; the size of the flock, including adults and young; the number of months the animals stayed on the field; the total surface area of the infields grazed by the animals; the size of the grazing field we selected.
<!-- There was no mixed-grazing in the fields we selected. -->

Other information related to the farm management are available in Supplementary Information (@tbl-farmermanagement).

The standard calculation of stocking density is made with the following formula [REF]:
$$
\text{Stocking density} = \frac{\text{number of animals}\times{\text{standard livestock unit}}}{\text{surface}\times{\text{grazing period}}}
$$
However, estimating stocking density for small-scale grazing systems is not as straightforward as for conventional grazing, mainly because of rotational management. Most farmers move their livestock all year round across different fields according to their productivity or state at some point in time, without following a recurring schedule. Due to this strategy, most farmers could not give us accurate estimations on the average time period the livestock spent on the specific field we selected. This information was not available either in the 2018 survey. Therefore, we decided to arrange the stocking density formula to estimate an average stocking density for the farms total infield area over a whole year.

$$
\text{Average stocking density} = \frac{\text{number of adults}\times{\text{standard livestock unit}} + \text{number of young animals}\times{\text{young animal livestock unit}} }{\text{total infield area of the farm}}
$$
Young animals (1 year old or less) were included in our calculation. As there is no standard livestock unit for young sheep and goats, we estimated it as half the value of adult sheep and goats. The total grazing area was retrieved from the NIBIO map of agricultural properties (https://gardskart.nibio.no/). We gathered in this category areas classified as infields (*inmark*), but also unclassified surrounding areas which were known as grazing fields from the farmer and/or from field pictures. Two farms (IG1 and IG2) had their livestock moved to summer farms every year. In these cases, average stocking density was calculated for the time period when animals were in the lowlands.

## Data analysis

All statistical and ordination analyses were performed on R (v.4.3.0) with R-Studio (v.2023.03.1+446) [@rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2023]. The canonical correlation analyses and the related statistical tests were made with the CCA [@gonzalezCCACanonicalCorrelation2021] and CCP [@menzelCCPSignificanceTests2022] packages. The redundancy analyses were performed with the vegan package [@oksanenVeganCommunityEcology2022]. The visual representations of RDA were made using the ggord package [@beckGgordOrdinationPlots2022]. All data with in-field replication were summarized at the site level, by sum for beetle captures and by average for all other variables.

We used canonical correlation analysis to investigate the relationships between sets of drivers at different scale and community data of dominant grasses, forbs, and beetle families. Canonical correlation analysis searches for the maximum correlation between linear projections of two data sets [@hotellingRelationsTwoSets1992].
<!-- This method highlights linear relationships between two sets of variables. -->
We used both a frequency and an abundance criteria to define dominant plant species and beetles families. To be characterised as dominant species, grasses (Poaceae) and forbs should be found in at least one-third of the sites with an average quadrat percent cover of at least 1% across all sites. For beetles, we selected families which were present in at least one-third of the sites and with a minimum average of 3 collected individuals across all sites. Eight species of grasses, seven species of forbs and six families of beetles fulfilled the criteria and were selected for their respective community tables [**REF TABLE**]. Community data were log-transformed to limit the influence of extreme values to which canonical correlation analysis is particularly sensitive [**REF**].

As canonical correlation analysis only accounts for quantitative variables, livestock type was transformed into dummy numeric. All explanatory variables were centered and scaled to address the high heterogeneity of units within most of the driver sets. The statistical power of our analysis being limited by first, our low replication level (n = 29), and second, the assumption of linearity of the canonical correlation, we verified and filtered our explanatory variables according to the following features: 1) Raw data distribution; variables with highly skewed distributions or with obvious outliers were removed. 2) Variable colinearity; we tested colinearity between variables within driver sets with paired plots. When the correlation coefficient was equal to or over 0.8 between two variables, if applicable we kept the one with the highest in-site replication, otherwise the choice was made according to ecological relevance. 3) Linearity assumption between explanatory driver sets and community data; we performed Tukey tests on linear model residuals between community ordination scores and individual explanatory variable [**REF**]. Ordination scores were extracted either from preliminary Detrended Correspondance Analysis (DCA), or from Principal Component Analysis (PCA) if the DCA's first axis length was under 2 units. The final list of variables kept for the canonical correlation analysis is shown in [**table**].

We made three canonical correlation series, one for each assemblage (grass, forb, beetle). For each series, we performed canonical correlation between sets of explanatory variables according to cascading influence [@fig-fjordconcept], and between explanatory variable sets and assemblage sets. We tested the statistical significance of correlations with the asymptotic approximation of Hotelling-Lawley Trace (*p.asym* function in CCP package) [@mullerPracticalMethodsComputing1984]. We investigated further on significant canonical correlations with Redundancy Analyses (RDA) [@legendreNumericalEcology2012]. For illustrative purpose, we performed RDAs on all combinations of sets and provided them in Supplementary Information. Abundance data were transformed using Hellinger transformation, which lowers the weight of variables with low counts and many zeros [@borcardNumericalEcology2011; @legendreEcologicallyMeaningfulTransformations2001] [*question for Adam - I guess it is redundant to cumulate log transfo and Hellinger transfo ?*]. The R^2^, which is biased by the number of independent variables and sample size, was adjusted [@legendreTestingSignificanceCanonical2011; @peres-netoVariationPartitioningSpecies2006]. We tested the statistical significance of RDA models, axes and terms with permutations [@legendreTestingSignificanceCanonical2011; @legendreNumericalEcology2012] and we checked the residual variation using the Kaiser-Guttman criterion [*suggested by Philippe Massicotte from who I followed the RDA guidelines https://pmassicotte.github.io/stats-denmark-2019/, but do not really know how to refer to that*].

## Cascading interactions between environmental and anthropogenic drivers

There was a strong correlation between the fjord system set and the landscape set (@fig-cancor), with the first dimension of the canonical correlation significant for all series and the second dimension significant for the forb and beetle series [**ref to summary table**]. It was confirmed by the RDA performed on all variables from both sets (R^2^~adj~ = 0.14, F~4~ = 2.14, pval = 0.011). The most important factors were average maximum July temperature (var = 0.44, F~1~ = 2.89, pval = 0.035) and distance from sea (var = 0.4, F~1~ = 2.63, pval = 0.041), which drove axes 1 and 2 respectively (@fig-rda A). The proportion of forest area around the field increased with increasing distance from sea and maximum summer temperature, while the opposite was observed for the proportion of outfield area. The other land cover type which responded to fjord characteristics was the wetland area, which was strongly associated with sites further away from the sea. There was however no trend on the proportion of cultivated land and infield areas.

We could observe another noticeable correlation between the landscape set and the fine-scale environment set, even if it was not consistently significant across series (@fig-cancor). The RDA model including all variables from both sets was not significant (R^2^~adj~ = -0.02, F~5~ = 1.13, pval = 0.66) and did not emphasize any term (@fig-rda B). We can observe that the first axis (var = 0.1, F~1~ = 1.94, pval = 0.72) showed a gradient opposing the proportion of outfield area to the proportion of forest area, which could illustrate the underlying geographical gradient (@fig-rda A).

In both RDA models the proportion of unexplained variance was high (over 1 for the first axis). It was particularly striking for the landscape x fine-scale model, for which high residual variation was detected on four dimensions (PC1 1.76; PC2 1.19; PC3 1.05; PC4 0.85).

We did not detect any other significant interaction with the canonical correlation analyses between explanatory sets, but we could observe some trends across series. Grazing management was overall weakly correlated to the fjord system and the landscape (@fig-cancor). Fine-scale environment showed consistent low correlation with the fjord system, and was also weakly correlated with the grazing management for the grass and forb series. *+Maybe a few words on RDA in SI*

## Drivers of grass, forb and beetle assemblages

Overall, drivers beyond the fine-scale environment showed very little if no correlation with plant and beetle assemblages (@fig-cancor). The only noticeable influences were from the fjord system and the grazing management on the grass assemblage. However, none of the subsequent RDA models were significant, and neither the fjord system (R^2^~adj~ = -0.04, F~4~ = 0.76, pval = 0.74) and the grazing management (R^2^~adj~ = -0.04, F~5~ = 0.79, pval = 0.77) showed explanatory power. The landscape set was not significantly correlated with any assemblage.

Grass and forb assemblages were compared with almost the same set of fine-scale explanatory variables, except from the measure of aspect which was discarded from the forb series because of non-linearity assumption (**ref to var summary table**). The canonical correlation with fine-scale environment was significant for the grass assemblage and only marginally significant for the forb assemblage (**ref to summary table**). On the other hand, the RDA model was significant for the forb assemblage (R^2^~adj~ = 0.15, F~5~ = 1.96, pval = 0.005) and not for the grass assemblage (R^2^~adj~ = 0.06, F~6~ = 1.32, pval = 0.14). For both assemblages, phosphorus was a significant term (for grass: var = 0.022, F~1~ = 2.92, pval = 0.027; for forbs: var = 0.035, F~1~ = 2.45, pval = 0.038). *Deschampsia cespitosa*, *Ranunculus repens* and *Ranunculus acris* were associated with higher phosphorus concentration, while *Festuca rubra*, *Poa pratensis* and *Galium saxatile* were associated with lower phosphorus concentration (@fig-rda D-E). We can observe that bulk density, which was also a surrogate for total nitrogen (**ref to var summary table**), was at best marginally significant (for forbs: var = 0.03, F~1~ = 2.08, pval = 0.07) and did not interact with phosphorus concentration in any model. On the other hand, pH was strongly correlated with phosphorus concentration for the forb assemblage, while the two factors seemed completely unrelated for the grass assemblage. 

The second driver highlighted in the RDAs for both grass (var = 0.017, F~1~ = 2.16, pval = 0.061) and forb (var = 0.035, F~1~ = 2.43, pval = 0.028) assemblages is the penetration rate, which we used as an indicator of soil resistance induced by root density. We can observe that *Deschampsia flexuosa* and *Potentilla erecta* were closely associated with soil with lower resistance, while *Trifolium repens* was associated with soil with higher resistance (@fig-rda D-E). Interestingly, bulk density and penetration rate interacted differently according to the functional group: the two factors were correlated for the grass assemblage, while they were rather inversely correlated for the forb assemblage. It would mean that soil compaction and soil resistance are equivalent environmental constraints for forbs, while they are not necessarily related for grasses.

Regarding the interaction between fine-scale environment and beetle assemblage, even if both the canonical correlation (**ref to summary table**) and the RDA model (R^2^~adj~ = -0.08, F~7~ = 1.34, pval = 0.20) were not significant, some marginal explanatory power was still brought by bulk density (var = 0.005, F~1~ = 3.63, pval = 0.019) and average vegetation height (var = 0.004, F~1~ = 2.47, pval = 0.094). Ptiliidae were associated with less-compacted soils while Carabidae were more tolerant to compaction (@fig-rda D-F). We can also observe, even if it was not significant, that the presence of Scarabaeidae seemed associated with a higher percent cover of the bryophyte layer.

# DISCUSSION

Fine-scale drivers, and in particularly soil, were the most influential on plant and beetle assemblages. On the other hand, we did not identify any clear influence of the grazing management, the landscape or the fjord system. Nevertheless, we observed strong cascading effects on landscape from the climatic conditions induced by the fjord geomorphological characteristics.

## Edaphic parameters as main drivers

- Edaphic parameters main drivers of plant species composition [@siefertScaleDependenceVegetationenvironment2012]

### Nutrient

Quite unsurprisingly, grassland plant assemblages were affected by soil phosphorus, which is generally more limiting than nitrogen in agroecosystems [**REF**]. Nutrient distribution across our study sites (data not provided) confirmed that nitrogen was overall well if not exceedingly supplied, while phosphorus was morel likely to be lacking. Nutrient-rich soils should favour more competitive species, which are usually the most desirable from an agronomic perspective, over species with higher tolerance to environmental stress [**REF**].

- But interesting pattern which showed in our RDA, as both *Festuca rubra* and *Poa pratensis* were closely associated at the lower end of the phosphorus gradient. If the former is a stress-tolerant [**REF**], low productive species, the latter is highly productive fodder species [**REF**].
- Explanation might be found within plant associations -> comparison with phytosociological surveys of @losvikHayMeadowCommunities1993 and @losvikPhytosociologyEcologyOld1988 in Hordaland hay meadows
- @skornikEffectGrazingPressure2010 found both species as characteristic of heavily grazed grassland community composition on mesic soil
- In @klimekPlantSpeciesRichness2007a, *Poa trivialis* positively correlated with nitrogen fertilisation -> trend confirmed in our analysis, even if it nitrogen was not a significant driver
- For forbs, *Ranunculus acris* and *Ranunculus repens* were both positively correlated with phosphorus concentration (in @klimekPlantSpeciesRichness2007a, *Ranunculus acris* negatively correlated with nitrogen), while *Galium saxatile* was negatively correlated -> phytosociological associations
- Contrary to grass communities though, nitrogen and phosphorus gradients were not correlated -> Distribution of nitrogen and phosphorus in the plant shoots differs according to functional type [@chanetonNitrogenPhosphorusCycling1996] -> could uptake in general differ?
- Likewise, effect of pH on forb communities was closely related to phosphorus, while they both were independent for grass communities
- pH is a very important determinant of plant community composition [@zelnikPlantSpeciesDiversity2013] as it affects availability of nutrients by altering their chemical forms -> more acidic field will be poorer -> going back to *Galium saxatile* ?
- transition to small methodological point -> we used total N extraction, which is not representative of the plant-available N, while P-extraction was more specific to available forms
- effect of P and N on pant community composition not always visible [@andersonRainfallSoilsModify2007]

### Soil structure

- Soil structure was the second most important driver of plant community and was the most influential factor on beetle assemblage
- We characterised soil structure by bulk density and penetration rate: when the measure of bulk density is a standardised method which indirectly assesses compaction by relying on the proportion on empty space over the whole volume [**REF**], penetration rate is an in-field, direct measurement of the soil resistance to pressure, and thus includes the root density in the resistance ability of the soil.
- Example with thick grass root mat which stabilises but also "immobilizes" the soil
- Interestingly, bulk density and penetration rate interacted differently according to the target community: no interaction for grasses, rather opposed for forbs (soft soil associated with low BD), rather correlated for beetles (soft soil associated with high BD) -> more details on how both indicators could be complementary
- Penetration rate never correlated with phosphorus, so maybe no link with grazing intensity -> check with RDA in SI how BD and penetration relate to stocking density and cows
- Both *Deschampsia flexuosa* and *Potentilla erecta* closely associated with soft soil -> back to @losvikPhytosociologyEcologyOld1988

- *Achillea millefolium* associated with steeper slopes -> should be a way to link that to soil structure

- For beetles, family which was the most sensitive to high bulk density was Ptiliidae
- Ptiliidae are very small and are not likely to be able to create their own way in the soil like bigger families such as Carabidae and Scarabaeidae can do - though they are mostly flying and should not be ground-diggers
- Even though they are mainly associated with dung, they could be affected by other environmental factors
- Transition to methodological point: most studies investigated dung-associated beetle community would focus on Scarabaeidae, while this family only is far from representing the whole range of coprophragous species, which includes specimens from Silphidae, Hydrophylidae, Ptiliidae, Staphylinidae -> would be important to expand the focus beyond Scarabs (actually "dung beetle" is per default associated with Scarabs only while this group is acknowledged as paraphyletic).

## Grazing management

### Grazing management -> direct effect

- Grazing management was not significantly correlated with plant and beetle assemblages, even if an underlying trend was suggested by the canonical correlation analysis
- Grassland community responses to grazing management are not straightforward, especially in observational studies where the different features (intensity, periodicity, livestock type) are combined.
- First a look at experiments to investigate each factor independently
  - Intensity
    - grazing intensity in sheep grazing only significant on plant composition if heavy [@skornikEffectGrazingPressure2010]
  - Continuous vs rotational
    - increase prostrate species biomass & decrease of species dominance with rotational grazing [@boavistaEffectsGrazingRegimes2019]
  - mixed vs single
    - aboveground diversity, multidiversity and multifunctionality higher under mixed grazing [@wangDiversifyingLivestockPromotes2019]
    - no effect of mixed grazing on plant composition [@jerrentrupDiverseSwardsMixedGrazing2020]
  - livestock type
    - weak effect of livestock on species composition over time, with increase of forb contents and species richness under cattle grazing compared with sheep [@jerrentrupLittleGrazerSpecies2015]
- Then references to observational studies

### Grazing management -> indirect effect

- The correlation between grazing management and fine-scale environment of plants, which mostly revolved around edaphic factors, was particularly low
- Potential indirect effect linked to phosphorus gradient -> check RDA in SI grazing x fine-scale


### The methodological point

Our objectives in this study was not to investigate the effect of grazing management on grassland communities *per se*, but rather to question its level of influence in comparison with environmental drivers across scales. Unfortunately, it may have been the category the most affected by our methodological approach. First of all, the number of replicates was low for both the scope (cross-scale multivariate) and the type (canonical correlation) of analysis. For example, each livestock type was represented by 9 or 10 fields, which is an insufficient level of replication considering the amount and range of environmental variation within our study area, that we were willing to capture. Most generally, the characterisation of smal-scale grazing systems is particularly challenging, due to the diversity of practices between and within the farms [**REF**]. Even if only considering components directly associated with the grazers, such as number of animals, grazing period, type of livestock, as the common strategy relies on rotational management, reducing the assessment to a unique field fails to capture the whole system dynamic [**REF**]. A more pertinent approach would be to scale-up the studies at farm level [**REF**].

- Other management practices that we did not include in our analysis, such as fertilisation, could have been influential, notably on the soil. Different types of fertilisation were used by the farmers, ranging from lime/sand and manure to artificial fertilisers
- Literature point on the effects of different fertiliser types
- Unfortunately, data on fertilisation practices were relatively scarce and inconsistent. Most farmers would communicate if they fertilised their fields and what kind of fertilisers they used, but information on amount, periodicity and frequency were missing. The type of fertilisers alone could not be included in the analysis as its distribution across sites was very uneven (canonical correlation biais).

- Even small conventional intensification steps, such as low artificial fertilizer use, can negatively affect species richness without systematically increase yield (@beckmannConventionalLandUse2019). Though this is context-dependent, we can consider that within our survey area we do have a gradient of intensity (@tbl-farmermanagement)



## Cascading interaction across scales

- For the landscape: as we focused on main species for the plant communities and on main families for the beetle assemblages, We probably lack resolution to be able to detect any effect. If present, forest or wetland specialists would not weight much in the pools and probably be part of the rare species -> low level of replication, low resolution

- increase of extreme temperature with distance to sea and forest -> continental less mild than close to sea, maybe having average summer temperature would be relevant

- influence of broad-scale variables smaller if not invisible at small extent and grain [@siefertScaleDependenceVegetationenvironment2012]

- strong effect of slope on meadows composition compared to pastures, where elevational gradient is substantially smaller [@klimekPlantSpeciesRichness2007a]
- increased species turnover induced by grazing with rainfall [@andersonRainfallSoilsModify2007]
- The productivity potential of individual grazing fields in small-scale farming is dependent from both natural and anthropogenic factors, which can be so deeply intertwined that it is difficult and maybe not always pertinent to treat them independently [REF].
- Topographical characteristics and soil quality have been shown to be drivers of plant community composition in managed grasslands, but overall variation explained for species composition quite low, especially compared to species diversity [@klimekPlantSpeciesRichness2007a]
- precipitation and temperature affect species dominance [@milchunasQuantitativeEffectsGrazing1993], but pondered according to grazing evolutionary history
- grazing effect on plant diversity and composition influenced by site productivity [@lezamaVariationGrazinginducedVegetation2014]


## Limitation

- Canonical analysis -> works best with high number of replicates as it should require normal distribution of variables.
- Methodological implication -> different outcomes with cancor and RDA

## Perspectives

- No taxonomic group can be a good surrogate of all the others for assessing effects of landscape and/or land-use in agricultural environment [@billeterIndicatorsBiodiversityAgricultural2007]
- Importance of including different taxa, because responses differ [@gonthierBiodiversityConservationAgriculture2014]
