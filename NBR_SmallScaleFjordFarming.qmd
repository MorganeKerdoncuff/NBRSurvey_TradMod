<!-- # REVISION SUMMARY -->

<!-- - *Title* - Inger' suggestion, which I quite like even if I feel something is missing, so do not hesitate to propose more options -->
<!-- - *Introduction* - I revised most of the structure of the Introduction following Adam' suggestion to make the hierarchical description of the different scales of influence clearer. Now the cross-scale approach stands out more as the main focus of the paper as it should be. I also decided to remove the mention to ecosystem services as this topic was never built upon in the rest of the manuscript (and I think we have enough material to work with already). -->
<!-- - *Clarification regarding the naming of explanatory sets of variables* - The former terms (fjord, landscape, grazing, fine-scale environment) brought confusion because they were mixing scales and causes. I thus decided to only refer to scale, using namely regional, landscape, field and fine. -->
<!-- - *Conceptual figure* - was modified to meet the police size requirements (min 7 pt) for submission, as the text was barely readable in the previous version. -->
<!-- - *NBR study map* - I corrected the size of the points for site location (there was indeed a difference, my mistake), changed the colour of the border, and adapted the map frame to include Bergen. **However** the background layer was unfortunately not available anymore, so I had to rely on orthophotogaphy instead. I also attached version only based on the relief, **please tell me which one you think is best**. -->
<!-- - *Material and methods* - two main changes regarding the variable selection in the regional and field sets for the sake of relevance and accuracy.  -->
<!--   1) Regional set - While running exploratory analyses on climate data for writing the context section of the PhD thesis, I found that **annual temperature range showed a surprisingly clean linear increase with longitude, thus offering a good proxy for the oceanity gradient**. I therefore ran once more the variable selection process for the regional set including average July temperature, average January temperature, and annual temperature range calculated as max July - min January. Only average January temperature and annual temperature range showed strong colinearity, and the former was thus discarded. This modification in the regional set did not lead to any substantial change of the results, except for the significance of individual terms in the regional x landscape RDA model. Distance to the closest fjord became significant instead of annual precipitation, which previous p-value was only around 0.044 (so basically not a strongly supported influence). **I have kept "temperature range" as variable name, please tell me if you think it is best to change it to "oceanity"** (as oceanity is what I refer to in the Discussion).  -->
<!--   2) Field set - I discarded the variable representing total infield area of the farm, which conflicted with the field scale and was potentially redundant with the relative infield area in the landscape matrix. This modification had no consequence on the results. -->
<!-- - *Results* - the main change in this section is the relationship between beetle dominant assemblage and the landscape matrix. **This result is not new or related to any changes described above**. I just failed to notice it previously due to my way of filtering statistics in my script. -->
<!-- - *Discussion* - new structure better matching the rest of the paper with 1) Fjord x landscape, 2) Fine-scale x plant, 3) Landscape x beetle, 4) Grazing. Each section has been rearranged according to Adam's last review, and content has now been considerably thinned down to key outcomes. Key modifications in each section:  -->
<!--   1) First some explanation on fjord x land use history, and then I included the critical discussion on "broad-scale gradients";  -->
<!--   2) First stronger emphasis on fine-scale x plant, second individual predictors (vegetation structure and soil), and I decided to discard the paragraph discussing why nutrients did not show as important predictor - **please tell me if you think it is too much to discard it all and if you still thinks mentioning it is important** -->
<!--   3) More detailed interpretation on the landscape x beetle, and then I merged the two sections discussing methods. Again much shorter, **please tell if it was too much of a cut.** -->
<!--   4) Similar as above: more detailed interpretation on grazing effect and a bit shorter in the methods/perspectives -->
<!-- - *Tables* - I have tried every possible alternative for tables to look at least readable on Word while writing on Quarto, but it is truly a lost cause. It is possible to submit a LaTex document, so this is what I will go for (see PDF version for accurate output). -->

# ABSTRACT

Pasture-based husbandry have shaped plant and animal communities of high diversity, which support the functionality of grassland ecosystems.
However, the direct impact of grazing management on the composition of these communities is not as straightforward, due to complex interactions between management and underlying environmental gradients.
<!-- Small-scale farming has ensured sustainable food production around the world by adapting management practices to the capacity of ecosystems and to the environmental constraints. -->
<!-- In Western Norway, farmers have addressed the constraining environment of the fjord region by relying on small-scale grazing systems, involving low stocking density and multiple livestock types.  -->
<!-- However, assessing the independent effect of such practices on plant and animal communities in this context is challenging, due to the complex interactions between the environment and the management across multiple spatial scales. -->
Here we present an attempt at disentangling these interactions across multiple spatial scales in an exploratory study of the agroecological system of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, Western Norway.
We used both canonical correlation analyses and redundancy analyses to investigate 
1) links between the regional environment, the landscape matrix, the field management and the fine-scale environment of the grazing fields, and 
2) links between these factors and dominant grass, forb and dung-associated beetle assemblages.
The composition of the landscape matrix was correlated with the regional environment, showing an increase of land use intensity with closer proximity to fjords.
Dominant grass and forb assemblages were correlated with the fine-scale environment of the grazing fields, according to gradients of vegetation structure and soil resistance to penetration.
Dominant dung-associated beetle assemblages were weakly correlated with the landscape matrix, mostly related to the percent cover of forested areas around the grazing fields.
Relationships involving field management were the least consistent, highlighting the challenge of accurately capturing the independent effect of farming practices in small-scale grazing systems.

# HIGHLIGHTS

- We performed the first analysis of cross-scale interactions between environmental gradients and grazing management in the agroecological landscape of the fjord region of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, Western Norway.

- Land use at landscape-scale was more affected by the distance to the closest fjord than regional gradients of temperature and precipitation.

- The strongest edaphic predictor of dominant grass and forb assemblages was soil resistance to penetration, while soil moisture and nutrient availability only showed negligible contribution.

- Dung-associated beetle assemblages, which were largely dominated by the Staphylinidae family, were more affected by landscape-scale factors than local-scale factors.

- Field-scale assessment and standard grazing indicators showed limitations in capturing the inherent spatiotemporal variability of rotational management.
We therefore recommend developing farm-scale approaches and more flexible methodological designs for small-scale grazing systems.

# INTRODUCTION

<!-- Industrialised agriculture and globalized food chains have pushed the capacity of the Earth system beyond its limits [@ipbesThematicAssessmentReport2024; @richardsonEarthSixNine2023], leading human societies towards alarming scenarios if business-as-usual is to continue [@egliWinnersLosersNational2018; @foleySolutionsCultivatedPlanet2011; @hunterAgriculture2050Recalibrating2017]. -->
<!-- In recent years, farming systems based on small-scale production and diversified management have received growing attention [@altieriPerspectivesChallengesAgroecology2024; @ronningenWesternEuropeanApproaches2012]. -->
<!-- They were shown to provide sustainable alternatives, by supporting biodiversity and the delivery of multiple ecosystem services while ensuring the livelihood of local communities [@gardnerAgriculturalResiliencePerspectives2019; @rasmussenJointEnvironmentalSocial2024]. -->
<!-- Multiple models of small-scale agriculture have been developed across a wide range of ecosystems, based on the common principle that farming practices should be adapted to the local environment [@cunninghamCloseYieldgapSaving2013; @holt-gimenezAgroecologyFoodSovereignty2012]. -->
<!-- The functionality of such agroecological systems thus relies on mutual interactions between underlying environmental gradients and management, which determine the diversity and composition of plant and animal communities [@denglerBiodiversityPalaearcticGrasslands2014]. -->
<!-- In such contexts, the effects of management on plant and animal communities are tightly entangled with the influence of underlying environmental gradients, which operate at different spatial scales and interact with one another [@denglerBiodiversityPalaearcticGrasslands2014; @petersCrossScaleInteractions2007; @sinclairOptionsContextApproach2019]. -->
<!-- With such strong context-dependency, assessing the independent effect of management on biodiversity requires a good understanding of the underlying ecological processes which drive the responses of plant and animal communities [@denglerBiodiversityPalaearcticGrasslands2014; @petersCrossScaleInteractions2007; @sinclairOptionsContextApproach2019]. -->

Plant and animal communities of semi-natural grasslands result from a long history of management involving mutual interactions between human, domestic grazers and the local environment [@denglerBiodiversityPalaearcticGrasslands2014; @ellisLandUseEcological2021].
These communities have ensured the long-term production of livestock, either by directly supplying the forage resource (e.g. grasses, forbs) [@collombCorrelationFattyAcids2002; @frenchSpeciesCompositionDetermines2017], or by indirectly supporting its provision through for instance nutrient cycling (e.g. dung-associated beetles, soil fauna) [@bardgettBelowgroundBiodiversityEcosystem2014; @nicholsEcologicalFunctionsEcosystem2008].
In Europe, recent research has shown how agricultural intensification have led to the simplification of semi-natural grassland communities, and its subsequent impact on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning [@allanLandUseIntensification2015; @schilsPermanentGrasslandsEurope2022].
However, the effects of management on plant and animal communities in low-intensity grazing systems are not as consensual [@scohierHowSheepAffect2012; @wangGlobalMetaanalysesResponse2019] and overlap more strongly with underlying environmental gradients [@denglerBiodiversityPalaearcticGrasslands2014].
Disentangling these interactions is therefore necessary to understand to what extent farmers can affect the productivity and diversity of their fields [@redlichDisentanglingEffectsClimate2022].

The influences of environmental gradients and management on plant and animal communities in semi-natural grasslands operate across multiple spatial scales [@denglerBiodiversityPalaearcticGrasslands2014; @petersCrossScaleInteractions2007].
At the regional scale, variation in climate and elevation generates gradients of abiotic stress and resource availability, affecting species distribution through habitat filtering and mitigating biotic interactions within communities [@conradiResourceAvailabilityDetermines2017; @fridleyLongerGrowingSeasons2016; @klanderudImportanceBioticVs2015].
The resulting patterns of primary productivity determine ecosystems' resilience to disturbance, and by extension their capacity for sustaining different types of land use [@piipponenGlobalTrendsGrassland2022].
At the landscape scale, connectivity between semi-natural habitats contributes to the diversification of species pools [@billeterIndicatorsBiodiversityAgricultural2007; @zulkaSpeciesRichnessDry2014] and ensures the stability of functional networks [@fantinatoCooccurrenceDifferentGrassland2019; @neffCrossscaleEffectsLand2019].
Agricultural intensification disrupts species migration and the continuity of the landscape matrix, leading to the simplification of natural communities and their ecological interactions [@kareivaConnectingLandscapePatterns1995; @leprovostContrastingResponsesBelowground2021; @seiboldArthropodDeclineGrasslands2019].
At the field scale, the strongest selective pressure usually comes from land use [@neffCrossscaleEffectsLand2019] and varies in direction and magnitude according to the type and intensity of the management [@gaujourFactorsProcessesAffecting2012].
In grazing systems, multiple factors such as stocking density, grazer selectivity or fertilisation can affect species dominance by favouring competitive or ruderal strategies [@koernerChangeDominanceDetermines2018; @olffEffectsHerbivoresGrassland1998].
Manure deposition and animal excreta also support the activity of a diversified coprophilous beetle community [@daoudiCompositionPhenologyBeetle2022; @sigsgaardEnvironmentalDNAMetabarcoding2021], which facilitates the nutrient cycling process between the livestock, the soil and the vegetation [@nicholsEcologicalFunctionsEcosystem2008].
Lastly, the fine-scale environment in the fields, including gradients of topographic (e.g. slope angle, aspect), edaphic (e.g. soil moisture, bulk density, nutrient availability) and biotic (e.g. vegetation height, litter cover) parameters, determines plant resource availability [@fayGrasslandProductivityLimited2015; @klimekPlantSpeciesRichness2007] and arthropod ecological niches [@broseBottomupControlCarabid2003; @coleInfluenceFinescaleHabitat2010].
Some factors, such as topography, are inherent to the local context, while other factors such as soil physicochemical properties or vegetation structure are also influenced by management, with for instance livestock trampling and grazing affecting soil compaction and vegetation height respectively [@mayelHowDoesGrassland2021; @zhangSoilPhysicalChemical2019].

A suitable framework for investigating cross-scale interactions within agroecological systems is the UNESCO World Network of Biosphere Reserves (WNBR) and its associated Man and Biosphere (MAB) program [@unescoManBiosphereProgramme2025; @unescoNewRoadmapMan2017], which offer a platform of international collaboration and knowledge-sharing for the regional implementation of the Agenda 2030 Sustainable Development Goals [@barracloughGlobalKnowledgeAction2023; @unitednationsTransformingOurWorld2015].
<!-- As model areas, Biosphere Reserves promote applied research targeting food security, locally adapted agricultural production and sustainable land use in many rural regions around the world [e.g. @anderzenEffectsOnfarmDiversification2020; @kratzerRuralInnovationsBiosphere2019; @tamouPastoralistsChangingEnvironment2018]. -->
In Western Norway, the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve encompasses in a nutshell the typical agroecological landscape of the fjord region [@kalandNordhordlandBiosphereReserve2018], which has been shaped by a long history of small-scale farming and livestock grazing [@austadHumaninfluencedVegetationTypes1991; @hjelleLongtermChangesRegional2018].
<!-- The strong topographic gradient has limited the mechanisation and intensification of agriculture, and extensive land use has promoted high ecological diversity and strong cultural values [@bohnetCocreatingCulturalNarratives2025; @cusensParticipatoryMappingReveals2022; @fjellstadPatternsChangeTwo1999]. -->
The Nordhordland small-scale grazing systems include different types of farm structure, ranging from extensive sheep and goat farming to more production-oriented mixed dairy-beef systems [@potthoffNorwegianLowintensityOvine2023].
Farmers usually rely on rotational grazing to limit the stocking density on individual fields and allow grasslands to recover [@indrelidFarmingSystemIts1988].
<!-- The small-scale grazing systems of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve is characterised by low stocking density, local adaptation of livestock breeds and high grazer mobility across fields [@indrelidFarmingSystemIts1988; @potthoffNorwegianLowintensityOvine2023]. -->
These different management practices would be expected to generate taxonomic and/or functional divergences in plant and animal communities of semi-natural grasslands [@boavistaEffectsGrazingRegimes2019; @lenoirEffectsTimingGrazing2010; @tothLivestockTypeMore2016].
However, the agroecological system of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve is also characterised by strong environmental gradients associated with the fjord context, including oceanity, topography and climate [@nesjeFjordsNorwayComplex2009].
In these circumstances, the structure and composition of communities are likely to be affected by multiple interactions between grazing management and different levels of environmental variation, which, to our knowledge, have yet to be investigated in the agroecological landscapes of the fjord region.

<!-- The small-scale grazing systems of the fjord region are thus characterised by strong interactions between the underlying environmental gradients and grazing management practices, which, to our knowledge, have yet to be investigated.  -->
<!-- Plant and animal communities of semi-natural grasslands are thus likely to be affected by multiple interactions between grazing management and different levels of environmental variation, which, to our knowledge, have yet to be investigated in the agroecological landscapes of the fjord region. -->

In this study, we relied on a spatially-explicit approach to explore (1) links between field management and environmental gradients and (2) their respective influences on dominant assemblages of semi-natural grasslands in the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.
We classified the explanatory factors into four main spatial scales, based on a conceptual representation of the small-scale grazing systems in the fjord region of Western Norway (@fig-fjordconcept):
the **regional scale**, representing the climate and landform gradient associated with the fjord context; 
the **landscape scale**, related to the composition of the landscape matrix surrounding the grazing fields; 
the **field scale**, characterising the grazing management of the field; 
and finally the **fine scale**, including variables related to vegetation and soil structure, topography and nutrients.
We selected grass three indicator communities in relation to their key contributions to forage provision in semi-natural grasslands:
grass and forb species, as direct determinant of forage availability and nutritional quality;
and dung-associated beetle families, as indirect support of forage production through their role in the nutrient cycling process.

<!-- - In Europe, the semi-natural grasslands shaped/created by extensive livestock grazing are amongst the last biodiversity hotspots [@habelEuropeanGrasslandEcosystems2013], but their conservation is impaired by the poor economic viability of the associated agronomic production/farm structure/farming system [@mcginlayThreatAbandonmentSocioecological2017; @stensekeBiodiversityLocalContext2006]. -->
<!-- - Currently threatened due to limited/poor economic viability, need for thorough research to understand the functioning of the agro-ecosystem, especially in a way that would support farmer ability and willingness to pursue their activity [@mcginlayThreatAbandonmentSocioecological2017; @sinclairOptionsContextApproach2019; @stensekeBiodiversityLocalContext2006]. -->
<!-- - Agro-ecological systems are most often investigated as biodiversity hotspots [@buissonAncientGrasslandsGuide2022], with a focus on diversity and/or rarity indicators, while species/taxa associated with the productivity/primary function, such as dominant grass and forb species determining forage quantity and quality [@frenchSpeciesCompositionDetermines2017; @marrsReleaseSheepGrazing2020] or the dung-associated community for decomposition and nutrient cycling [@nicholsEcologicalFunctionsEcosystem2008] received less attention. -->

# MATERIAL AND METHODS

## Study area

The Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve is located in the fjord region of Western Norway, between the Bergen region to the south and the Sognefjord, Europe's deepest and longest fjord, to the north [@kalandNordhordlandBiosphereReserve2018]. 
The area is characterised by strong elevation and climate gradients from west to east, with average July temperature dropping from 15.9 to 8.3°C and annual precipitation increasing from 1550 to 4800 mm [@ketzlerClimateNorway2021; @meteorologiskinstituttNorskKlimaservicesenter2023]. 

In the summers of 2019 and 2020, we conducted an ecological survey on 29 grazing fields distributed across the southern part of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, all located below 250 m above sea level (@fig-sitemap).
Our sites were "infields" (*innmarksbeite*), defined by the Norwegian AR5 land cover classification system as "*agricultural land that cannot be harvested mechanically* \[with\] *at least 50% of the area* \[...\] *covered with cultured grass or pasture-tolerant herbs*" [@ahlstromAR5Klassifikasjonssystem2019]. 
All fields had been grazed uninterruptedly for at least 10 years, and had been grazed by the same livestock type, either sheep, goats or cattle, for at least the last 5 years. 
According to the farmers, most fields had been continuously grazed for at least 50 years; 
three had short gaps in their grazing history (5 years or under), and one had a long gap (20 years). 
Grazing intensity was low, with a maximum stocking rate of 0.6 yearly unit per ha. 
Twenty-one sites were enriched at least occasionally with individual or simultaneous use of artificial fertiliser, manure or shellsand-lime mix. 
To the knowledge of the farmers, no field had been resown and/or plowed since at least the 1970s, and only four out of the 29 sites received upgraded drainage between 1990 and 2010.

## Data collection

We visited each of the 29 sites once, starting in mid-June at the westernmost sites and ending in late July at the easternmost sites to account for the spring bloom time difference [@karlsenVariabilityStartGrowing2007]. 
On each site, we laid out a nested sampling design within a representative area of 400 m^2^, preferentially 20 m x 20 m but when necessary 40 m x 10 m, avoiding rocks, waterlogged ground, trees and field edges.
According to the same exclusion rules, we set three plots of 3 m x 3 m in the sampling area, at least 6 m apart from each other (@fig-sampling). 
Each plot was divided into nine subplots of 1 m^2^, five of them dedicated to non-destructive plant community observations, and the remaining four used for destructive sampling of the dung-associated beetle community and soil.

![Schematic representation of the nested sampling design applied in a representative area of each site. Field sampling was carried out on the same day except for beetle trapping.

### Grass, forb and dung-associated beetle assemblages

In each non-destructive subplot (15 per site), all plant species were identified using the Nordic flora [@mossbergGyldendalsStoreNordiske2018] and attributed an average percent cover by one of the same two observers.
When necessary, specimens were collected, coded and brought for microscopic or expert identification.
We determined the average percent cover of bare ground, rock and litter, and estimated average vegetation height out of three random measurements within the subplot.

In each destructive subplot (12 per site), we collected dung-associated beetles with dung-baited pitfall traps set for one full week between early July and early August.
Traps were made of white plastic cups of 1 L (diam. 10.5 cm, height 11.5 cm) filled to 1/4 with salted water, with a drop of neutral detergent to break water surface tension. 
The cups were covered with a square metal grid of 2 cm x 2 cm mesh size pegged into the ground, on which we put a ball of about fist size of previously-frozen cattle dung.
The dung ball was placed at the centre of the grid, at least 3 cm from the edge of the cup to provide enough space for beetles to fall in.
Beetles were stored in 70% ethanol and identified to the family level using the identification key from @duffBeetlesBritainIreland2012a.
The sampling design resulted in a spatial clumping of pitfall traps, but it was not deemed to cause spatial autocorrelation or affect our abundance data [@bakerEvaluatingSpatialAutocorrelation2006; @wardEffectsPitfallTrap2001].

### Soil data

We characterised soil structure using three complementary measurements: 
soil resistance to penetration, induced by root mat density and soil texture; 
bulk density, as a proxy for soil compaction;
and gravimetric water content, indicating water holding capacity. 
We measured soil resistance to penetration twice in each destructive subplot (24 per site), by dropping a sharpened metal rod of 43.4 cm length (diam. 2.2 cm; weight 1.3 kg) from 1 m above ground through a PVC tube to ensure vertical fall. 
The visible standing part of the stick was measured and subtracted from the total stick length to obtain the length of penetration into the soil. 
Before dropping the stick, the surrounding vegetation around a 5 cm radius was cleared to prevent resistance from the aboveground vegetation. 
The tip was regularly sharpened and remeasured to account for the decrease in length, which was of 1.6 % (0.7 cm) by the end of the sampling season.

For bulk density and gravimetric water content, we sampled three soil cores with PVC tubes of 57.23 cm^3^ (diam. 3.7 cm, height 10 cm) in each destructive subplot (36 per site). 
To limit soil compression during collection, we sharpened the edges of the PVC tubes and cut the surrounding root mat with a knife while pushing down the cores. 
Samples were covered with plastic foil and stored at 6°C before processing in the lab. 
If necessary, the soil volume of each core was corrected for holes or unfilled space prior to weighing.
We discarded cores with less than 50 cm^3^ of soil to prevent inaccurate measurements of bulk density and soil moisture, which represented approx. 20% of the total collected cores.

Gravimetric water content is calculated as the difference in proportion between the soil moist weight and the soil dry weight, and bulk density as the soil dry weight related to its volume:


$$
\text{Gravimetric water content}\; (\%) = \frac{\text{Core moist weight}\;(g) - \text{Core dry weight}\;(g)}{\text{Core moist weight}\;(g)}*100
$$

$$
\text{Bulk density}\;(g/cm^3) = \frac{\text{Core dry weight}\;(g)}{\text{Core volume}\;(cm^3)}
$$

Moist weight is usually measured from freshly sampled soil.
However, as weather conditions varied considerably during our sampling period, we standardised the measurement by weighing soil 48h after water saturation in the laboratory. 
Dry weight was obtained after 24h of drying in the oven at 105°C. 
After data filtering of low volumes and some negative values linked to a weighing balance dysfunction during lab processing, all sites had at least 9 measurements of bulk density and gravimetric water content each.

For chemical analyses, we sampled soil with a stainless steel cylindrical core of 200 cm^3^ (diam. 10.5 cm; height 12 cm) in each destructive subplot. 
The soil was stored at 4°C before being sieved and merged at the plot level (3 per site).
We sent 0.5 L of each pooled sample to a certified analysis laboratory to determine total nitrogen content with modified Kjeldahl method (NS-EN 13654-1:2890) [@bremnerDeterminationNitrogenSoil1960], and available phosphorus concentration with ammonium lactacte extraction method [@brayDeterminationTotalOrganic1945].

### Regional environment data

lm_oceanity <- lm(maxtempJuly-mintempJan ~ EPSG.25832_X, data = oceanity)

```

On site, we recorded field coordinates (SCR EPSG:25832), elevation, and field slope angle with a compass clinometer. 
We determined slope aspect degree and distance to the closest fjord from a Digital Elevation Model of 10 m x 10 m cell size retrieved from the GeoNorge online map catalogue of the Norwegian Mapping Authority [@kartverketGeoNorgeKartkatalogen2023]. 
Average annual precipitation, maximum and average July temperatures, and minimum and average January temperatures, were obtained from 1 km^2^ daily projections provided by the Norwegian Centre for Climate Services over the period 2010-2020 [@wongGridded112016]. 
Average annual temperature range, calculated as the difference between maximum July temperature and minimum January temperature, showed a strong linear relationship with longitude (adjusted R^2^ = `r op(summary_oceanity$adj.r.squared, 2)`, F = `r op(summary_oceanity$fstatistic[1], 0)`, p-value = `r op(summary_oceanity$coefficients[2,4], 3)`) and was used as a proxy for oceanity.
For sites not covered by the daily projections, data were extrapolated from averaging values of neighbouring cells with the R software package *terra* (v. 1.7.29) [@hijmansTerraSpatialData2023; @rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2024].

### Landscape matrix data

We calculated land use percent cover in a 1 km radius area around each field from land cover data provided by the Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research (NIBIO) [@norskinstituttforbiookonominibioKildenArealinformasjon2023].
Land cover was categorised according to the AR5 land cover classification system [@ahlstromAR5Klassifikasjonssystem2019], that we simplified into eight categories:

### Field management data

We conducted phone interviews with 23 farmers from October 2021 to January 2022 to collect information on field management. 
For the 3 out of 26 farmers who were unable or unwilling to reply to our survey, we used data from a similar interview series conducted in 2018 [@reiersenBaerekraftVestnorskLandbruk2019]. 
We asked the farmers for the following elements: 
the type of livestock which has been grazing the site for the past 5 years; 
the size of the flock, including adults and young; 
the grazing period on the visited field; 
the total surface area of infields grazed by the animals on the farm; 
the size of the grazing field we selected as a survey site.

Stocking density is usually calculated as follows: 

$$
\text{Stocking density} = \frac{\text{number animals}\times{\text{standard livestock unit}}}{\text{area}\times{\text{grazing period}}}
$$ 

However, estimating stocking density for individual fields was challenging, as  most respondents could not give us accurate field occupation periods due to the regular transfers of livestock during the season.
We thus arranged the formula to calculate instead an average stocking density for the farms' total infield area over a year:

$$
\text{Average stocking density} = \frac{\text{Nadults}\times{\text{standard  LU}} + \text{Nyoung}\times{\text{young LU}} }{\text{total infield area of the farm}}
$$ 

We defined the reference livestock unit (LU) for young sheep and goats as half the value of adult (0.05 LU). 
The total infield area within each farm was retrieved from the map of agricultural properties made by the Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research (https://gardskart.nibio.no/). 
We included both areas classified as infields (*innmark*) and unclassified areas which were known as grazing fields from the farmer and/or from field observation. 
For two farms (IG1 and IG2) where livestock was moved to mountain summer farms every year, we calculated average stocking density for the time period when animals were in the lowlands.

## Data analysis

We first used canonical correlation analysis, which searches for the maximum correlation between linear projections of two datasets [@hotellingRelationsTwoSets1992], to investigate 1) links between sets of explanatory variables characterising the regional environment, the landscape matrix, field management and the fine-scale environment of semi-natural grasslands, and 2) links between these explanatory sets and dominant grass, forb and dung-associated beetle assemblages (following scheme in @fig-fjordconcept).
We then used redundancy analysis (RDA) [@legendreNumericalEcology2012] to get insight into the effect of individual variables and assess robustness of the results.

Prior to analyses, we averaged all data from the nested sampling design at the site level.
We standardised all explanatory variables (environmental gradients and grazing management variables) to 0 mean and standard deviation 1.
We further checked and filtered all variables, removing variables with highly skewed distributions or with obvious outliers, and secondly by testing variable collinearity within each set with the Spearman's rank correlation test. 
For a correlation coefficient of 0.8 or higher, variables were selected first according to the highest within-site replication, and second according to the most even distribution.
We found high collinearity between average January temperature and annual temperature range (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.93), and between bulk density, gravimetric water content, loss of ignition, total nitrogen content and humus content (Spearman's rank correlation coefficients ranging from 0.78 to 1).
The variables kept for the canonical correlation analysis are shown in @fig-fjordconcept and their statistical summary can be found in @tbl-varsum.

Assemblage data were percent cover for grass (Poaceae) and forb species, and abundance for beetle families. 
We filtered taxa according to their frequency and abundance across sites: 
species or families found in at least one-third of the infields, with a minimum average percent cover of 1% for plants and a minimum average occurrence of 3 for beetles, were selected for the analysis. 
In total, eight species of grasses, seven species of forbs and five families of beetles were selected (@fig-fjordconcept). 
Community data were transformed using Hellinger transformation, which lowers the weight of variables with low counts and many zeros [@borcardNumericalEcology2011; @legendreEcologicallyMeaningfulTransformations2001].

We tested for statistical significance of correlations with asymptotic approximation of Hotelling-Lawley Trace (*p.asym* function in CCP package) [@mullerPracticalMethodsComputing1984], and statistical significance of RDA models, axes and terms by ANOVA-like permutation (n = 999) [@legendreTestingSignificanceCanonical2011; @legendreNumericalEcology2012].
For illustrative purpose, we performed RDAs on all combinations of sets and provided them in Supplementary Information.

All statistical analyses were performed in R (v.4.4.1) with R-Studio (v.2024.04.2+764) [@positteamRStudioIntegratedDevelopment2024; @rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2024]. 
The canonical correlation analyses and the related statistical tests were made with the *CCA* [@gonzalezCCACanonicalCorrelation2023] and *CCP* [@menzelCCPSignificanceTests2022] packages. 
The redundancy analyses were performed with the *vegan* package [@oksanenVeganCommunityEcology2024] and their visual representations were made with the *ggord* package [@beckGgordOrdinationPlots2022].

## Cross-scale interactions between environmental gradients and management

The landscape matrix was significantly correlated with the regional environment, with a correlation coefficient rho of `r op(envar$rho[1], 2)` (F approximation of Hotelling-Lawley trace F~30,82~ = `r op(envar$approx[1], 2)`, p-value = `r op(envar$p.value[1], 3)`) (@fig-cancorenvi; @tbl-cancorenv) and an adjusted R^2^ of `r op(rdastat_envi$adj.r.squared[1], 2)` (F~5~ = `r op(rdastat_envi$F[1], 2)`, p-value = `r op(rdastat_envi$PrF[1], 3)`) (@tbl-rdaregio).
The first axis of the RDA model was significant (F = `r op(rdastat_envi$F[3], 2)`, p-value = `r op(rdastat_envi$PrF[3], 3)`) and mainly driven by fjord proximity (F = `r op(rdastat_envi$F[9], 2)`, p-value = `r op(rdastat_envi$PrF[9], 3)`), which was associated with a decrease of forest and outfield areas and an increase of cultivated and infield areas (@fig-rdaregiolandscape).

The relationship between field management and the fine-scale environment was found significant in the redundancy analysis only, with the RDA model explaining a low proportion of variance (R~adj~^2^ = `r op(rdastat_envi$adj.r.squared[48], 2)`, F~4~ = `r op(rdastat_envi$F[48], 2)`, p-value = `r op(rdastat_envi$PrF[48], 3)`) (@fig-cancor A; @tbl-rdafield).
The first axis of the RDA model was marginally significant (F = `r op(rdastat_envi$F[51], 2)`, p-value = `r op(rdastat_envi$PrF[51], 3)`) and mostly driven by livestock type (F = `r op(rdastat_envi$F[52], 2)`, p-value = `r op(rdastat_envi$PrF[52], 3)`) and field area (F = `r op(rdastat_envi$F[54], 2)`, p-value = `r op(rdastat_envi$PrF[54], 3)`), with bigger fields and/or fields grazed by sheep weakly associated with higher cover of bryophytes, more compact soil and lower vegetation height (@fig-rdafieldfine).

## Influence of the environmental gradients and management on dominant grass, forb and dung-associated beetle assemblages

According to the canonical correlation analyses, dominant grass assemblages were significantly correlated with the fine-scale environment (rho = `r op(comvar$rho[4], 2)`, F~56,86~ = `r op(comvar$approx[4], 2)`, p-value = `r op(comvar$p.value[4], 3)`) and the regional environment (rho = `r op(comvar$rho[1], 2)`, F~35,77~ = `r op(comvar$approx[1], 2)`, p-value = `r op(comvar$p.value[1], 3)`), and marginally correlated with the field management (rho = `r op(comvar$rho[3], 2)`, F~28,66~ = `r op(comvar$approx[3], 2)`, p-value = `r op(comvar$p.value[3], 3)`) (@fig-cancorgrass; @tbl-cancorcom).
However, only the fine-scale environment explained a significant proportion of the grass assemblage variance in the corresponding redundancy analysis (R~adj~^2^ = `r op(rdastat_grass$adj.r.squared[28], 2)`, F~8~ = `r op(rdastat_grass$F[28], 2)`, p-value = `r op(rdastat_grass$PrF[28], 3)`) (@tbl-rdagrass).
The first axis was significant (F = `r op(rdastat_grass$F[30], 2)`, p-value = `r op(rdastat_grass$PrF[30], 3)`) and essentially driven by a gradient of vegetation structure, with increasing vegetation height in one direction along the axis (F = `r op(rdastat_grass$F[33], 2)`, p-value = `r op(rdastat_grass$PrF[33], 3)`) and increasing bryophyte cover in the opposite direction (F = `r op(rdastat_grass$F[32], 2)`, p-value = `r op(rdastat_grass$PrF[32], 3)`) (@fig-rdafinegrass).
*Deschampsia cespitosa* and *Holcus lanatus* were associated with taller vegetation, while at the opposite end *Poa pratensis* was associated with higher bryophyte cover.
The second axis was marginally significant (F = `r op(rdastat_grass$F[31], 2)`, p-value = `r op(rdastat_grass$PrF[31], 3)`) and represented an edaphic gradient linking high soil acidity (F = `r op(rdastat_grass$F[36], 2)`, p-value = `r op(rdastat_grass$PrF[36], 3)`) with low resistance to penetration (F = `r op(rdastat_grass$F[37], 2)`, p-value = `r op(rdastat_grass$PrF[37], 3)`). 
*Deschampsia flexuosa* was associated with softer and more acidic soils, while *Festuca rubra* and *Holcus lanatus* were associated with greater soil resistance to penetration and lower acidity level.

The fine-scale environment was also correlated with dominant forb assemblages, with a correlation coefficient rho of `r op(comvar$rho[9], 2)` (F~56,86~ = `r op(comvar$approx[9], 2)`, p-value = `r op(comvar$p.value[9], 3)`) (@fig-cancorforb; @tbl-cancorcom).
The fine-scale environment explained `r op(rdastat_forb$adj.r.squared[28]*100)`% of the forb assemblage variance (RDA model: F~8~ = `r op(rdastat_forb$F[28], 2)`, p-value = `r op(rdastat_forb$PrF[28], 3)`) (@tbl-rdaforb). 
The first axis was significant (F = `r op(rdastat_forb$F[30], 2)`, p-value = `r op(rdastat_forb$PrF[30], 3)`) and mainly driven by soil penetration (F = `r op(rdastat_forb$F[37], 2)`, p-value = `r op(rdastat_forb$PrF[37], 3)`), which was inversely related to soil pH and available phosphorus concentration (@fig-rdafineforb).
*Potentilla erecta* and *Galium saxatile* were associated with softer and more acidic soils, while *Ranunculus acris* and *Trifolium repens* were associated with stronger soil resistance to penetration and lower acidity level.
The gradient of vegetation structure was represented by the second axis, non-significant (F = `r op(rdastat_forb$F[31], 2)`, p-value = `r op(rdastat_forb$PrF[31], 3)`).
Average vegetation height was the most important factor (F = `r op(rdastat_forb$F[33], 2)`, p-value = `r op(rdastat_forb$PrF[33], 2)`), with *Trifolium repens* associated with shorter vegetation (@fig-rdafineforb).

According to the canonical correlation analyses, dung-associated beetle assemblages were significantly correlated with the regional environment (rho = `r op(comvar$rho[11], 2)`, F~25,87~ = `r op(comvar$approx[11], 2)`, p-value = `r op(comvar$p.value[11], 3)`), the landscape matrix (rho = `r op(comvar$rho[12], 2)`, F~30,82~ = `r op(comvar$approx[12], 2)`, p-value = `r op(comvar$p.value[12], 3)`) and the field management (rho = `r op(comvar$rho[13], 2)`, F~20,74~ = `r op(comvar$approx[13], 2)`, p-value = `r op(comvar$p.value[13], 3)`) (@fig-cancorbeetle; @tbl-cancorcom). 
However, none of the corresponding RDA models were significant, and only the landscape matrix explained a fair share of variance (R~adj~^2^ = `r op(rdastat_beetle$adj.r.squared[10], 2)`, F~6~ = `r op(rdastat_beetle$F[10], 2)`, p-value = `r op(rdastat_beetle$PrF[10], 3)`) (@tbl-rdabeetle).
The first axis was essentially driven by the proportion of forested areas (F = `r op(rdastat_beetle$F[15], 2)`, p-value = `r op(rdastat_beetle$PrF[15], 3)`), which was associated with a higher relative abundance of Carabidae and Hydrophilidae (@fig-rdalandscapebeetle).

# DISCUSSION

The composition of the landscape matrix of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve was influenced by the geography of the fjord region, with an increase of more intensively managed areas such as infields and croplands towards the nearest fjord shorelines.
Plant assemblages were correlated with the fine-scale environment and responded to gradients of soil penetration and of vegetation structure.
For dung-associated beetle assemblages, landscape-scale factors explained the highest proportion of variance.
However, we found no clear evidence of an effect of field management on the fine-scale environment or on dominant plant and beetle assemblages of the grazing fields.

## Fjord geography influences the landscape but not finer scales

The development of agriculture in Western Norway has been limited by the low productivity and the strong environmental constraints of the fjord region [@fjellstadPatternsChangeTwo1999; @piipponenGlobalTrendsGrassland2022].
In our study, the greater influence of fjord proximity over other regional factors suggests that, within the investigated range, the environmental context at the individual fjord level has stronger influence on the landscape than the broader oceanity and elevation gradients.
Local communities relied on both land and water resources to ensure their livelihood, using the fjords not only for fishing but also for the transport of livestock and people [@brekkeKulturhistoriskVegbokHordaland1993; @hetlandPluriactivityStrategyEmployment1986].
Crops and hay-meadows were thus mostly cultivated and managed along the fjords and fjord arms, while less-accessible grasslands and shrublands were used for extensive grazing [@indrelidFarmingSystemIts1988; @olssonAgroecosystemsNeolithicTime1991].
It is likely that the agricultural transition of the second half of the XX^th^ century further increased contrast in the landscape, with on the one hand the abandonment of agricultural fields and the development of the forestry industry in the outermost areas, and on the other the intensification of livestock production in fertile areas [@beleHeritageBoundariesNatureculture2024; @hamreLandcoverStructuralChanges2007].
<!-- For example, the diversity of fjords' shape, width and direction locally creates suitable micro-climatic conditions for fruit production, facilitating the expansion of orchards over grazing areas [@licinaAppleGrowingNorway2024]. -->

In comparison, the magnitude of variation associated with the climate and landform of the fjord region did not appear strong enough to generate a clear divergence in the dominant plant and beetle assemblages of the investigated semi-natural grasslands.
The sensitivity of our analysis to broader gradients was probably limited by the spatial range of our ecological study (approximately 900 km^2^), for which local climatic and topographic variables would have stronger influence than regional processes [@siefertScaleDependenceVegetationenvironment2012].
Inconsistencies between the outcomes of the canonical correlation analyses and the redundancy analyses may also be due to the existence of more complex non-linear interactions that we did not manage to capture [@dixonhamilCrossscaleContradictionsEcological2016; @petersCrossScaleInteractions2007].
Further research would therefore require a more robust, spatially-explicit methodological framework to investigate cross-scale processes in the fjord region more thoroughly [e.g. @redlichDisentanglingEffectsClimate2022].
Such studies are resource-demanding, but are becoming increasingly relevant in the current context of climate and land use changes [@bardgettCombattingGlobalGrassland2021; @kremenLandscapesThatWork2018].

<!-- We attempted to capture the main environmental gradients on the regional scale, but it necessarily simplified the topographic complexity of fjord environment [@beylichLandscapesLandformsNorway2021; @nesjeFjordsNorwayComplex2009]. -->
<!-- First, our choice of variables for the regional-scale explanatory set may not have been as representative of the environmental heterogeneity driven by the fjord context [@beylichLandscapesLandformsNorway2021; @nesjeFjordsNorwayComplex2009]. -->
<!-- A measure of topographic complexity for instance, such as the variance of elevation or slope [e.g. @yuMultiscaleComparisonTopographic2015], may have been a better indicator of climate variation at low elevation [@graaeStayGoHow2018]. -->

## Plant assemblages determined by the fine-scale environment of grazing fields

Only the fine-scale environment explained a significant proportion of variance in dominant plant assemblages, compared with factors associated with the regional environment, the landscape matrix or the field management [@klimekPlantSpeciesRichness2007].
Plant community composition at fine grain is very sensitive to between-site variation [@raatikainenImpactsLocalRegional2007], but edaphic variables particularly have the strongest predictive power across scales [@siefertScaleDependenceVegetationenvironment2012].
Interestingly though, the most important edaphic predictor of dominant grass assemblages was not soil moisture [@merunkovaEnvironmentalControlSpecies2012; @zelnikPlantSpeciesDiversity2013] or nutrient availability [@critchleyAssociationLowlandGrassland2002; @klimekPlantSpeciesRichness2007], but soil resistance to penetration, which was independent from bulk density but systematically paired with a pH gradient.
Lower resistance on more acidic soils could be explained by the increased concentration of ammonium [@brittoNH4ToxicityHigher2002; @kleijnSearchKeyBiogeochemical2008] and ionic aluminium [@halingRootMorphologyRoothair2010; @kochianCellularMechanismsAluminum1995], which inhibit plant root growth and would thus lessen the resistance driven by the root mat [@forsterRootTraitsCrop2022]. 
However, experimental acidification in grasslands showed instead an increase of root density following a community shift from forbs to perennial grasses [@chenBioticCommunityShifts2015; @wangSoilAcidificationAlters2020]. 
We cannot extrapolate further on this soil acidity-resistance relationship without direct assessment of root length/density and standardised measurement of soil resistance to penetration [@sojkaSituStrengthBulk2001], but this interaction would be worth investigating further.

Grass and forb assemblages also responded to vegetation height, and to a lesser extent bryophyte cover, suggesting an underlying gradient of field productivity [@olffEffectsHerbivoresGrassland1998; @vanderwalMossesStruggleLight2005].
The tall and unpalatable *Deschampsia cespitosa* most probably contributed to increase average vegetation height when dominant, but considering the negative correlation with bryophyte cover it is unlikely that the gradient resulted from a confounding effect only.
Slope steepness was consistently associated with this gradient of vegetation structure but never significant, while @losvikHayMeadowCommunities1993 particularly highlighted a clear community divergence between drier, well-drained drained fields, and wetter, flat fields, in hay-meadows in Western Norway.
Considering the evolution of land use since @losvikHayMeadowCommunities1993 which, to date, is still the most comprehensive work on grassland communities in Western Norway, it would be relevant to lead a mirror study on the whole plant community to specifically assess if the relative influences of topographic, biotic and edaphic factors have changed over time.

<!-- Soil resistance to penetration depends not only on soil properties including structure, texture, water content and carbon ratio, but also on biotic components such as plant roots [@forsterRootTraitsCrop2022; @mirrehInfluenceSoilBulk1972; @sojkaSituStrengthBulk2001]. -->
<!-- Correlation with one or the other parameter is however far from being straightforward.  -->
<!-- For example, soil resistance has been found to be either strongly [@gabrielCoverCropsReduce2021; @negronConsequencesIntensiveGrazing2019], weakly [@kumiQuantifyingRootinducedSoil2023] or conditionally [@sojkaSituStrengthBulk2001] associated with water content, depending on the considered soil layer.  -->
<!-- Likewise, average plant root diameter and root volume tend to increase soil resistance in experimental conditions, but the consistency of observations could be highly variable depending on soil texture and plant species [@kumiQuantifyingRootinducedSoil2023].  -->
<!-- Slope angle can indirectly affect plant height and species composition through the depletion of soil nutrients [@kleinebeckerEffectsGrazingSeasonal2011] or the change of livestock foraging behaviour [@fynnManagingBrowsingGrazing2019; @hesterForagingBehaviourSheep1999], but its effect is likely to be mediated by the slope aspect [@bennieInfluenceSlopeAspect2006; @turtureanuScaleTaxondependentBiodiversity2014].  -->
<!-- The combined influence of slope angle and aspect can be assessed with the heat load index (HLI), which approximates the amount of solar energy directly hitting the ground and thus available for plant growth [@merunkovaEnvironmentalControlSpecies2012; @turtureanuScaleTaxondependentBiodiversity2014].  -->
<!-- HLI was initially considered to be included in the fine-scale environment set instead of slope angle and aspect as independent variables, but its calculation generated clear outliers that would have affected the robustness of the canonical correlation analyses. -->
<!-- In contrast with the outcomes from both long-term experiments [@hejcmanRengenGrasslandExperiment2010; @kiddImpacts120Years2017; @zarzyckiSchemeNutrientAddition2020] and observational studies [@critchleyAssociationLowlandGrassland2002; @klimekPlantSpeciesRichness2007; @raatikainenImpactsLocalRegional2007], we found no significant influence of soil available phosphorus or total nitrogen on dominant grass and forb assemblages.  -->
<!-- Plant growth is not only affected by the concentration [@fayGrasslandProductivityLimited2015], chemical forms [@ceulemansPhosphorusResourcePartitioning2017] or application modes (e.g. amount, frequency and timing) [@rosOptimalUsePhosphorus2020; @sittersImpactsBrowsingGrazing2019] of added nutrients, but also by their interactions with the existing soil nutrient pool [@bindrabanRevisitingFertilisersFertilisation2015], soil pH [@kiddImpacts120Years2017; @mengGlobalSoilAcidification2019] and the microbial community [@dincaFertilizationSoilMicrobial2022; @leechComparativeEffectAlternative2019].  -->
<!-- Total nitrogen, though widely used as indicator of fertilisation regimes for practical and cost-efficiency reasons [@hejcmanRengenGrasslandExperiment2010; @myklestadSoilSiteManagement2004], offers poor approximation of the actual concentrations of inorganic, available forms for plants (i.e. nitrate or ammonium) [@collinsSoilNitrateConcentrations2004; @stluceNitrogenDynamicsIndices2011].  -->
<!-- On the other hand, Bray's phosphorus extraction method should show relatively accurate estimation of phosphorus uptake by plants [@gilbertAvailableSoilPhosphorus2009].  -->

Bedrock type was not included in our analysis due to poor replication of the different categories in our set of sites, but *a posteriori* we did not observe clear trends in pH between soils from more acidic granitic gneiss (pH ranging from 4.3 to 5.0) and from more basic anorthosite (pH ranging from 4.9 to 5.1) [@norgesgeologiskeundersokelseNasjonalBerggrunnsdatabase2023]. -->
<!-- - Regarding soil pH for instance, mineral fertilisers such as inorganic nitrogen can dramatically acidify the soil [@kiddImpacts120Years2017], while animal manure and lime are usually used as neutralisers [@caiIntensifiedSoilAcidification2015; @hejcmanRengenGrasslandExperiment2010; @kalkhoranOptimalLimeRates2020; @xuModelbasedOptimalManagement2023]. -->
<!-- - + narrow time window which did not take in account farmer's time of fertilisation + seasonal variation of nutrient patchiness [@ryelTemporalDynamicsSoil1996] -->

## Dung-associated beetle families affected by the composition of the landscape matrix

Consistently with previous findings, landscape-scale factors had greater influence on beetle assemblages compared with local-scale and fine-scale factors [@liuFunctionalBeetleDiversity2014; @schweigerQuantifyingImpactEnvironmental2005].
The most important landscape driver of beetle communities is usually connectivity between semi-natural habitats [e.g. @burelDifferentialResponseSelected2004; @schweigerQuantifyingImpactEnvironmental2005].
However, contrary to flatter and more productive regions, the continuity of the agroecological landscape in Western Norway is not strongly disrupted by land use intensification [@cusensParticipatoryMappingReveals2022].
Forest patches are instead expected to be a source of woodland specialists, which could have increased the relative abundance of Carabidae and Hydrophilidae in nearest grazing fields [@avironCarabidAssemblagesAgricultural2005; @vanbergenEffectLanduseHeterogeneity2005].
This hypothesis should however be verified with a more thorough investigation of the dung-associated beetle community which, interestingly, was strongly dominated by Staphylinidae [see also @daoudiCompositionPhenologyBeetle2022].
The weak contribution of Scarabaeidae (only 2.5% of our total catches) shows how limited assessments solely based on typical "dung beetle" taxa (i.e. Scarabaeinae, Aphodiinae, Scarabaeidae or Geotrupidae) are, particularly in the Nordic region where Scarabaeinae and Aphodiinae are poorly represented [@artsdatabankenArtsdatabankenKunnskapsbankNaturmangfold2023].
Comprehensive investigations of the coprophilous community are challenging to accomplish in short-term studies, but can be facilitated by trait-based approaches [e.g. @tonelliEffectsProgressiveAbandonment2018] as well as DNA-based methods [e.g. @sigsgaardEnvironmentalDNAMetabarcoding2021], which are becoming increasingly accessible and reliable.

<!-- It would be interesting to verify this hypothesis by conducting a finer investigation of the beetle community, especially considering the dominance of the Staphylinidae family, which features very high functional, morphological and ecological diversity [@bohacStaphylinidBeetlesBioindicators1999; @irmlerEffectEnvironmentalConditions2018]. -->
<!-- Identification at the species level, however, is time-consuming and requires high expert knowledge, which are challenging to meet in short-term multi-taxa studies.  -->
<!-- More accessible alternatives are trait-based approaches [e.g. @neffCrossscaleEffectsLand2019], which also provide both fundamental knowledge on ecological interactions and applied prospects for habitat monitoring [@weissUnifyingFunctionalTrait2019]. -->
<!-- A suitable indicator for instance would be body size [e.g. @ngDisentanglingEffectsFarmland2018; @tonelliEffectsProgressiveAbandonment2018], whose role in ecological processes has been thoroughly investigated and whose assessment meets criteria of reproducibility and accessibility [@woodwardBodySizeEcological2005]. -->
<!-- First, there is a lack of consistency regarding dung beetle terminology, which can indiscriminately include the single Scarabaeinae (Scarabaeidae) [e.g. @nicholsEcologicalFunctionsEcosystem2008; @simmonsEcologyEvolutionDung2011], the Aphodiinae (Scarabaeidae) and the Geotrupidae [e.g. @buseSummaryMorphologicalEcological2018; @tonelliEffectsProgressiveAbandonment2018], or even the whole Scarabaeidae family [e.g. @arellanoDungBeetlesColeoptera2023].  -->
<!-- Second and more importantly, the above-listed taxa are not exclusive to the coprophilous trait, which is found in other families such as Hydrophilidae or Staphylinidae [@daoudiCompositionPhenologyBeetle2022; @hanskiDungInsectCommunity1991]. -->
<!-- Narrowing down ecological assessments to the dung-beetle group only could create critical research biases [@tonelliEffectsProgressiveAbandonment2018], particularly in the Nordic region where Scarabaeinae and Aphodiinae are poorly represented [@artsdatabankenArtsdatabankenKunnskapsbankNaturmangfold2023].  -->
<!-- Investigating the overall dung-associated community would undoubtedly require considerably more time and expertise, but it should nevertheless be encouraged [@daoudiCompositionPhenologyBeetle2022], especially with the tremendous potential offered now by DNA-based methods [e.g. @sigsgaardEnvironmentalDNAMetabarcoding2021]. -->

## Indirect effect of field management on plant assemblages?

We found no clear evidence of the direct influence of field management on dominant plant and beetle assemblages in the semi-natural grasslands of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.
However, we observed a weak relationship between field management and the fine-scale environment, which involved sheep grazing, field area and vegetation structure.
This correlation could be interpreted as either
an indication of a top-down process, with lower trampling pressure under extensive or sheep grazing associated with a more developed bryophyte layer [@ludvikovaLongTermDefoliation2014], 
or an indication of a bottom-up process, resulting from the farmers' decision to adapt livestock type and field area according to inherent grassland productivity [@demeauxJustGrazeIt2024]. 
Regardless, these results suggest that current farming practices in the semi-natural grasslands of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve do not override the inherent variation of plant communities driven by the fine-scale environment.

Overall, our study is quite representative of how challenging ecological assessments of small-scale grazing systems are in observational studies, particularly when rotational management is involved.
While in theory a *certain number of animals* is allocated on a *certain area of land* for a *certain period of time*, farmers continuously adapt their management to unforeseeable circumstances, such as for instance the livestock birth rate/survival or the timing of spring bloom [@nuthallIntuitiveWorldFarmers2012].
We witnessed it firsthand during our interviews, as the farmers themselves struggled to provide accurate grazing schedules for a single field.
These shortcomings led us to question how to address the inherent variability of small-scale farming systems in multivariate ecological studies [@sinclairOptionsContextApproach2019], as the replication level required for robust variance partitioning analyses is only met in wide-scale collaborative projects [e.g. Biodiversity Exploratories, see @fischerImplementingLargescaleLongterm2010].
Scaling up the study design from a single representative field to the whole farm matrix, and developing novel indicators based on a mosaic concept, could provide a better analytical framework for capturing the transfers of energy and livestock between fields [@deffontainesAgriculturalSystemsLandscape1995; @kokEuropeanBiodiversityAssessments2020].
Such strategy would also facilitate the application of ecological research through the experimentation of more innovative, transdisciplinary approaches and concepts [@wittmanSocialEcologicalPerspective2017], such as farm multifunctionality [@kremenLandscapesThatWork2018; @wilsonWeakStrongMultifunctionality2008] or life cycle assessments [@kokEuropeanBiodiversityAssessments2020].
Farmers are particularly crucial partners to involve during the research process [@lacombeDesigningAgroecologicalFarming2018; @lutzFarmerCooperationMeans2017], as they are 
1) knowledge-holders of land use history and local conditions [@ianniRevitalizingTraditionalEcological2015], 
2) managers of their fields and farm [@mcginlayThreatAbandonmentSocioecological2017], and 
3) key hubs of social-ecological networks, who build community-based experience favouring the resilience of local farming systems [@barracloughMappingStakeholderNetworks2022; @shiSocialInteractionEffect2021].
To support knowledge-building capacities amongst small-scale farming communities, along with large-scale dissemination of research outcomes, we recommend to use already leading global collaboration networks, such as the World Network of UNESCO Biosphere Reserve [@barracloughMappingStakeholderNetworks2022; @barracloughGlobalKnowledgeAction2023].

<!-- Despite a large pool of research, describing the effects of domestic grazing on the structure and composition of grassland communities remains far from straightforward [@scohierHowSheepAffect2012]. -->
<!-- Regarding grazing intensity for instance, plant community divergence is slow [@marriottLongtermImpactsExtensive2009], and mostly observed in grazing experiments under extreme treatments of abandonment or heavy intensification [e.g. @skornikEffectGrazingPressure2010; @pakemanLongTermImpacts2019], or in observational studies when including a wider stocking density range [e.g. @buzhdyganDirectIndirectEffects2020]. -->
<!-- Likewise for grazer selectivity, most studies reported that shifting to another livestock type [@cuchillohilarioForageSelectivityCattle2018; @fraserImpactSwardComposition2011] or to mixed grazing [@jerrentrupDiverseSwardsMixedgrazing2020; @pakemanLongTermImpacts2019] for up to 15 years did not change the community composition.  -->
<!-- Such complex rotational dynamics have also led to different management histories:  -->
<!-- whereas drastic land use changes were rare amongst our sites (only two with former forestry and cropping, respectively), we recorded livestock shifts for two-thirds of them, most often from cattle to sheep or sheep to cattle, and mostly happening during the last 30 years.  -->
<!-- Considering the lack of consistent information on grazing rotations, we excluded any form of temporality amongst our grazing management variables but potentially at the expense of a fair share of explained variance [@allanInterannualVariationLanduse2014; @leprovostLanduseHistoryImpacts2020]. -->
<!-- -   *Functional resource heterogeneity*, which determines animals accessibility to fodder, is driven both by broader, spatially-fixed or temporally-recurrent factors, such as climate, topography and geology, and by finer, spatially and temporally variable factors, as for instance the patchiness of rainfall, grazing or fertiliser spraying by farmers [@fynnManagingBrowsingGrazing2019]. -->
<!-- - only 15-20% variation in species composition plants, butterflies & carabids explained by all three scale heterogeneity (landscape, farm, field) [@weibullSpeciesCompositionAgroecosystems2003] -->
<!-- - in-field patchiness of vegetation structure with different grazing capacities created by cattle grazing [@gilhausCattleForagingHabits2014] -->
<!-- - limitation using species-based approach only: from savannah example, fodder quality of individual species dependent on rainfall and site productivity, as absence of limiting factors allow plant development towards defensive strategies against herbivores [@hopcraftHerbivoresResourcesRisks2010] -->
<!-- - no influence of rotational cattle grazing scheme on overall plant species composition but differences detected when narrowed at the life trait group in sub-alpine & alpine pastures [@perottiYearRotationalGrazing2018] -->
<!-- - Effects of domestic grazing can also be buffered by initial habitat productivity or diversity [@isselsteinEffectsLivestockBreed2007; @liuImpactsGrazingDifferent2015]. -->
<!-- - cattle vs sheep affected beetle community composition [@lyonsImpactsContrastingConservation2017] -->
<!-- - different plant species composition between cattle rotational and continuous grazing [@boavistaEffectsGrazingRegimes2019] -->
<!-- - A relatively consensual effect of grazing intensity is the reduction of vegetation height [@dorroughPlantNeighbourhoodLandscape2007; @isselsteinEffectsLivestockBreed2007; @pakemanLongTermImpacts2019], even if in our analysis the trend rather non-intuitively showed the opposite -->

# CONCLUSION

The agroecological landscape of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve is shaped by the geography of the fjord region, with an increase in land use intensity towards fjord shores.
Dominant plant assemblages of semi-natural grasslands were primarily determined by the fine-scale environment of the grazing fields, while dominant dung-associated beetle assemblages were rather affected by landscape-scale factors.
However, our analyses of the links between field management and the fine-scale environment as well as dominant plant and dung-associated beetle assemblages were largely inconclusive.
Considering the tight interactions between the farmer, the environment and the livestock in small-scale grazing systems, for further research we recommend to
1) explicitly address the inherent spatio-temporal variability of rotational management in farm-scale studies [@sinclairOptionsContextApproach2019], 
2) experiment transdisciplinary approaches with the farmers as main partners [@barracloughMappingStakeholderNetworks2022; @wittmanSocialEcologicalPerspective2017], and
3) integrate the outcomes of local studies as part of large-scale knowledge-sharing network, such as the UNESCO World Network of Biosphere Reserves [@barracloughGlobalKnowledgeAction2023].

<!-- In face of the global food security challenge, ecological research can be a lever for supporting the integrity and development of agroecological systems that promote high biological diversity, ensure landscape multifunctionality and local community sovereignty over their food system and land resources [@kremenLandscapesThatWork2018; @rasmussenJointEnvironmentalSocial2024]. -->
<!-- - We encourage more multi-scale studies investigating the ecological dynamics in the fjord system, investigating different response scales, organism responses [@billeterIndicatorsBiodiversityAgricultural2007; @gonthierBiodiversityConservationAgriculture2014] -->
<!-- - There is a need for more local studies on small-scale grazing or farming systems as the high environmental variation & high diversity of practices make the assessments difficult, especially when involving rotation, for which we encourage socio-ecological approaches [@wittmanSocialEcologicalPerspective2017] -->
<!-- - Socio-ecological approaches bring a breath of fresh air [@bernuesQuantifyingMultifunctionalityFjord2015; @cusensParticipatoryMappingReveals2022; @wittmanSocialEcologicalPerspective2017] -->
