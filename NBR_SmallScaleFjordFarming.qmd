# ABSTRACT

# INTRODUCTION

# MATERIAL AND METHODS

## Study area

The UNESCO Nordhordland Biosphere Reserve (NBR) is located in Western Norway. Its main geomorphological feature is the fjord landscape, the deepest arm reaching [NB] km inland. The climate is oceanic, characterized by mild temperature (mean January, mean June) and high precipitation level (). There are both temperature and precipitation west-east gradients [@kalandNordhordlandBiopshereReserve2018]. The coastal region buffers the climate seasonal cycle while temperature annual variation increases inland. The precipitation gradient is greatly affected by the topography: the mean annual precipitation is twice as much in higher elevation compared to the flat coastal areas.

## Study sites

We sampled 29 grassland fields across the Southern part of the NBR (@fig-sitemap) in 2019 and 2020.

Sites were either grazed by sheep, goats or cows for at least the past 5 years, and have been under grazing management for the past decade. The managements excluding grazing or the different treatments applied to the fields are described in Appendix [APPENDIX REF]. Grasslands were chosen to be representative of small-scale farming system in Western Norway, with low-intensity grazing and limited amount
