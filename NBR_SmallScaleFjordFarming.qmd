# ABSTRACT

# INTRODUCTION

## Sustainable food production through traditional grazing systems

## Intertwined drivers within small-scale farming systems in a fjord landscape (concept)

## Aim & hypotheses

# MATERIAL AND METHODS

## Study area

The UNESCO Nordhordland Biosphere Reserve (NBR) is located in Western Norway. Its main geomorphological feature is the fjord landscape, the deepest arm reaching [**NB**] km inland. The climate is oceanic, characterized by mild temperature (**mean January, mean June**) and high precipitation level (**VALUE**). There are both temperature and precipitation west-east gradients [@kalandNordhordlandBiopshereReserve2018]. The coastal region buffers the climate seasonal cycle while temperature annual variation increases inland. The precipitation gradient is greatly affected by the topography: the mean annual precipitation is twice as much in higher elevation compared to the flat coastal areas.

## Study sites

We sampled 29 grassland fields across the Southern part of the NBR (@fig-sitemap) in 2019 and 2020.

Sites were either grazed by sheep, goats or cows for at least the past 5 years, and have been under grazing management for the past decade. Grasslands were chosen to be representative of small-scale farming system in Western Norway, with low-intensity grazing and limited amount of inputs. The different treatments applied to the fields (grazing excluded) are described in Appendix [**APPENDIX REF**].

## Conceptual framework

*For Amy and Inger: I gathered everything related to the study concept here for now, but maybe some of this should be moved to the Introduction at some point*

The potential drivers of the plant and beetle community were divided into 4 categories regarding their scale of influence and their relationship with human activity. We first present a summary before describing each set of variables with more details (@fig-fjordconcept):

- the **fjord system** encompasses all geomorphological features which define the landscape and are independent of any human influence.
- the **landscape matrix** gathers the different land covers and uses which surround the field within 1 km2 radius. It is both dependent of the geomorphology and the human activity (forestry, crops, grazing, infrastructures...).
- the **grazing management** relates to the livestock breeding and to the structure of infield area of the farm. It is likely to be influenced by the landscape topography and the types of available habitats around the farm.
- the **fine-scale environment** at the sampling area level represents all the ecological parameters which can directly or indirectly influence the local niches. These drivers will be affected by all factors occurring at wider scale.

# RESULTS

## Main grass species

```{r CANCORgrass}
#| label: fig-cancorgrass
#| out-width: "800px"
#| fig-cap: "Canonical correlation system for the grass community"
#| message: true
#| warning: true
knitr::include_graphics("illustrations/NBR_CancorGrass.png")
```

### Effect of grazing

```{r VR_grazingxgrass12}
#| label: fig-grazingxgrass12
#| out-width: "800px"
#| fig-cap: "Visual representation of the dimensions 1 and 2 from the canonical correlation between the grazing management and the main grass species community"
#| message: true
#| warning: true
knitr::include_graphics("outputs/pval_significant/cancor_grazingxgrass_dim12.png")
```

```{r VR_grazingxgrass23}
#| label: fig-grazingxgrass23
#| out-width: "800px"
#| fig-cap: "Visual representation of the dimensions 2 and 3 from the canonical correlation between the grazing management and the main grass species community"
#| message: true
#| warning: true
knitr::include_graphics("outputs/pval_significant/cancor_grazingxgrass_dim23.png")
```

The total infield surface of the farm drives the first axis (@fig-grazingxgrass12), while the livestock types are opposing themselves (sheep in upper left, cow in lower left). *Lolium perenne* would be associated with farms with a high grazing surface. *Poa trivialis* and *Deschampsia cespitosa* would be associated with cow sites (@fig-grazingxgrass23).

```{r VR_locenvixgrass}
#| label: fig-locenvixgrass
#| out-width: "800px"
#| fig-cap: "Visual representation of the canonical correlation between the fine-scale environment and the main grass species community"
#| message: true
#| warning: true
knitr::include_graphics("outputs/pval_significant/cancor_locenvixgrass.png")
```

The first axis is driven by the penetration rate on the right and by the pH on the left (@fig-locenvixgrass). *Deschampsia flexuosa* seems associated with soft soils. The second axis is driven by the mean Phosphorus rate. *Lolium perenne* seems associated with rich soils.

## Main forb species

```{r VR_locenvixforb}
#| label: fig-locenvixforb
#| out-width: "800px"
#| fig-cap: "Visual representation of the canonical correlation between the fine-scale environment and the main forb species community"
#| message: true
#| warning: true
knitr::include_graphics("outputs/pval_significant/cancor_locenvixforb.png")
```

The first axis is also driven by the penetration rate on the right and by the pH on the left (@fig-locenvixforb). *Trifolium repens* seems associated with basic soil. The mean Phosphorus rate is isolated from all the other drivers and all the species on the upper-right corner. Forb species would not be favored by very rich environment.

## Fine-scale environment

```{r VR_grazingxlocenvibeetle}
#| label: fig-grazingxlocenvibeetle
#| out-width: "800px"
#| fig-cap: "Visual representation of the canonical correlation between the grazing management and the fine-scale environment"
#| message: true
#| warning: true
knitr::include_graphics("outputs/pval_significant/cancor_grazingxlocenvi_beetle.png")
```

First axis non-significant but quite clearly driven by livestock type (@fig-grazingxlocenvibeetle). High bryophyte cover seems associated with sheep and goat grazing.

## Influence of fjord system

```{r VR_fjordxlandscape12}
#| label: fig-fjordxlandscape12
#| out-width: "800px"
#| fig-cap: "Visual representation of the canonical correlation between the fjord system and the landscape matrix"
#| message: true
#| warning: true
knitr::include_graphics("outputs/pval_significant/cancor_fjordxlandscape_beetle_dim12.png")
```

```{r VR_fjordxlandscape13}
#| label: fig-fjordxlandscape13
#| out-width: "800px"
#| fig-cap: "Visual representation of the canonical correlation between the fjord system and the landscape matrix"
#| message: true
#| warning: true
knitr::include_graphics("outputs/pval_significant/cancor_fjordxlandscape_beetle_dim13.png")
```

The aspect and the distance to sea are driving the first dimension, the slope drives the second dimension and the elevation drives the third dimension. The forest cover would increase inland, with increasing elevation (@fig-fjordxlandscape12, @fig-fjordxlandscape13). On areas with steep slopes, the most important land use around the field would be infields and cultivated lands.
