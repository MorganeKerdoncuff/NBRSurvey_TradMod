# ABSTRACT

We aimed to present an exploratory study of the ecological interactions between grassland communities of dominant grasses, forbs and beetles, and sets of environmental factors which characterize low-intensity farming in Norwegian fjord across scales. We used canonical correlation analysis to determine linear correlations between sets of explanatory and community variables.


# INTRODUCTION

## Sustainable food production through traditional grazing systems

## Intertwined drivers within small-scale farming systems in a fjord landscape (concept)

The productivity potential of individual grazing fields in small-scale farming is dependent from both natural and anthropogenic factors, which can be so deeply intertwined that it is difficult and maybe not always pertinent to treat them independently [REF].

## Aim & hypotheses

# MATERIAL AND METHODS

## Study area

The UNESCO Nordhordland Biosphere Reserve (NBR) is located in Western Norway. Its main geomorphological feature is the fjord landscape, the deepest arm reaching \[**NB**\] km inland. The climate is oceanic, characterized by mild temperature (**mean January, mean June**) and high precipitation level (**VALUE**). There are both temperature and precipitation west-east gradients [@kalandNordhordlandBiopshereReserve2018]. The coastal region buffers the climate seasonal cycle while temperature annual variation increases inland. The precipitation gradient is greatly affected by the topography: the mean annual precipitation is twice as much in higher elevation compared to the flat coastal areas.

## Study sites

We sampled 29 grassland fields across the Southern part of the NBR (@fig-sitemap).

```

Sites were either grazed by sheep, goats or cows for at least the past 5 years, and have been under grazing management for the past decade. Grasslands were chosen to be representative of small-scale farming system in Western Norway, with low-intensity grazing and limited amount of inputs. To the knowledge of the current farmers, no field was resown and/or plowed since the 1970s. Four sites were drained between 1990 and 2010 (OS1, IC1, OS4, OC3). The different treatments applied to the fields (grazing excluded) are described in Appendix (@tbl-farmermanagement).

## Conceptual framework

*For Amy and Inger: I gathered everything related to the study concept here for now, but maybe some of this should be moved to the Introduction at some point*

The potential drivers of the plant and beetle community were divided into 4 categories regarding their scale of influence and their relationship with human activity. We first present a summary (@fig-fjordconcept) before describing each set of variables with more details:

-   the **fjord system** encompasses all geomorphological features which define the landscape and are independent of any human influence.
-   the **landscape matrix** gathers the different land covers and uses which surround the field within 1 km2 radius. It is both dependent of the topography and the human activity (forestry, crops, grazing, infrastructures...).
-   the **grazing management** relates to the livestock breeding and to the structure of infield area of the farm. It is likely to be influenced by the landscape topography and the types of available habitats around the farm.
-   the **fine-scale environment** at the sampling area level represents all the ecological parameters which can directly or indirectly influence the local niches. These drivers will be affected by all factors occurring at wider scale.

*To Amy and Inger: the following section ended up being quite long. One alternative to this description below (which may be more relevant in the thesis core which should be more detailed) would be to make a summary table, with the following columns: 1) The set; 2) The variable; 3) Its effect (key words, a bit same as the figure above); 4) references. What you think would be the best?*

### The fjord system

The fjords in Western Norway are characterized by undulating topography which grows sharper in the inner fjord area [STILL NEED TO DEFINE THESE AREAS AT SOME POINT?]. The following features can affect plant and beetle assemblages by filtering the *natural* species pool at wider scale [REF]:

- the **elevation**: our study focused on grasslands in the "lowlands", thus the elevation gradient was limited with all of our sites located below 200 m. Yet, even at low level elevation can have an effect on local climate. including temperatures and precipitations [REF].
- the **slope**: the fjord landscape alternates between hills and dips. The steepness of a slope affects the soil erosion potential as well as the water streaming: a sharp hill will suffer from regular soil renewal and nutrient depletion [REF], while a flat area will store higher water and carbon  content [REF].
- the **aspect**: South- and East-facing slopes will receive more, and more intensive sunlight than West- and North-facing ones [REF]. The combined aspect and angle determine the heat load received by the slope [REF].
- the **distance to sea**: fjords are first and foremost defined by the sea arms which enter deeply into the land. These geological formations greatly affect the local climate by constraining wind currents and clouds [REF].

### The landscape matrix

Land use being greatly constrained by the fjord topography, the agricultural landscape is usually diverse with woodlands and semi-managed outfields mixing with the grazing fields. The different habitat types around the site will affect the species pools and flows [REF]:

- the **forest percent cover**: it is common for land owners in the fjord countryside to keep some forested areas for wood supply. The dominant plant species community should not be affected, but phytophagous beetles (e.g. Elateridae) could migrate to neighboring areas [REF].
- the **wetland percent cover**: the fjords in Western Norway are well-irrigated thanks to a high precipitation level [REF]. Same as for the forest cover, it is likely that the common plant species pool will not be affected, but hydrophilous beetles (e.g. Hydrophilidae, Ptilidae) could be found in surrounding areas.
- the **cultivated land percent cover**: small-scale farming involves a high variety of food production strategies to adapt to the productivity gradient, with a limited use of agricultural machinery [REF]. Cultivated land are usually represented by fodder crops and orchards, which could influence the dominant pool of forbs in the surrounding grazing fields.
- the **outfield percent cover**: traditional grazing management in Western Norway revolved around the combined use of low productive outfields (usually heathlands or shrublands) and high productive infields, with biomass taken from the former in summer (e.g. heath mowing or summer grazing), to enrich the latter [REF]. There can be a fine line between outfields and infields, especially closer to the coast. A high cover of outfield would induce an overall lower productivity of the area.
- the **infield percent cover**: infields correspond to more conventional grazing areas, such as meadows and pastures. In an infield-dominant landscape, we would expect the dominant plant and beetle pools to be relatively stable.

### The grazing management

To accommodate the constraining topography and the limited resources, grazing like farming practices are very diverse. Grazing is a well-studied habitat pressure which can trigger contrasting responses depending on its intensity and the local context [REF]:

- the **type of livestock**: traditional grazing management in Western Norway used to rely on sheep breeding, but the livestock has been diversified with cow and goat flocks. Each type of livestock has distinct grazing patterns and diet preferences which can affect the plant community [REF]. The type of excretions, which differs a lot between ruminants and other herbivores, is also likely to influence the dung-beetle assemblage.
- the **grazing intensity**: productivity being a major limiting factor in fjord areas, grazing systems in Western Norway can be qualified as extensive, even on the most productive infields. However, there will still be a gradient of intensity according to the type of grazer, the number of animals and the grazing area.
- the **total infield surface**: rotational grazing is an important component of small-scale farming. The farmer divides the area into smaller fields where the livestock stays on shorter periods and rotates regularly during the year. Higher rotational capacity in extensive management system entails a lower grazing intensity.
- the **size of the field**: due to this rotational grazing system on a limiting topography, the size of each individual field can vary a lot between farms and within the same farm. A smaller field will be more sensitive to disturbances and to changes in species flows, and will be more subjected to edge effect [REF].

### The fine-scale environment

The last filters which apply to the plant and beetle assemblages would be the ones to define their immediate ecological niches, from both above- and below-ground [REF]:

- the **soil compaction**: soil structure plays a major role in plant root development, and subsequent exchanges within the rhizosphere [REF], and arthropod movements and potential cover against disturbance [REF]. Soil compaction, assessed with the measure of bulk density, usually increases with grazing intensity [REF]. Thick grass root mats can also stiffen the soil [REF], thus an in-field penetration test can provide complementary information to the regular bulk density measurement.
- the **soil chemical composition**: nitrogen and phosphorous are the most studied plant limiting factors in agronomy [REF]. As high concentrations favor competitive fodder species, we can expect a correlation between nutrient load and dominant grass communities. Soil pH will affect the availability of nutrients by altering their chemical forms, and can therefore influence the plant species composition (@zelnikPlantSpeciesDiversity2013)
- the **structural diversity**: available ecological niches for beetles are highly dependent of the heterogeneity of the aboveground biomass. It can be explained by feeding preferences (e.g. phytophagous) or strategies (e.g. hunters by sight) [REF]. Taller vegetation is usually associated with higher cover and more diverse niche potential [REF]. However the presence of exposed ground
- the **ground humidity**: moss + soil moisture

## Data collection

*For Amy and Inger: a sketch of the sampling design will obviously come*

### Sampling set-up

Ecological data were collected between June and July 2019 and 2020. A sampling area of 20 x 20 m^2^ which was representative of the grazing field was defined on each site. Field edges, wet zones and exposed rocks were avoided. Three plots of 3 x 3 m^2^ were set within the sampling area, with a distance of at least 6 m between each other. The plots were divided into 9 quadrats of 1 m^2^ which were split into two groups, one for non-destructive measurements (5 quadrats) and one for destructive measurements (4 quadrats). All samples from one site except beetles were collected the same day.

### Plant community data

Plant species and percent cover were collected on non-destructive quadrats, for a total of 15 quadrats per site. The identifications were made by the two same observers for both years. The percent cover of the different functional groups and the vegetation mean height were also collected on the same quadrat.

### Beetle community data

Beetle specimens were collected with dung-baited pitfall traps located on the destructive quadrats, for a total of 12 pitfall traps per site. The traps were made of white plastic cups of 750 mL (**DIAMETER**) filled to 1/4 with salted water and a drop of neutral detergent to break water surface tension [REF]. The traps were set into the ground with the edge at the same level as the soil surface and covered with a metal grid with a [**MESH SIZE**] of cm^2^. A ball of fresh cow dung was then placed on the middle of the grid roof in a way that it would leave a substantial empty space around the edge of the cups for the beetles to fall in. The traps were left on site for one full week before being retrieved.

Beetles were stored in 70% ethanol and sorted into families in the lab using @duffBeetlesBritainIreland2012b.

### Soil compaction data

All data collection related to soil physical properties was done in destructive quadrats.

For the measure of the penetration rate we used a sharp [**MATERIAL?**] stick which would be dropped into the ground from a 1 m height. The drop was made through a plastic tube to ensure the stick direction. The visible standing part of the stick was measured and substracted from the total stick length to obtain the length of penetration into the soil. We performed two penetration tests per quadrat, one on each upper corner (**FIG**), for a total of 24 tests per site. The tip was regularly sharpened and its length remeasured across the field season.

We sampled three soil cores of [**MEASURES**] in each quadrat for the measure of the bulk density, for a total of 36 cores per site. Cores were made of PVC tubes which edges have been sharpened. Prior to sinking the cores into the soil with a light hammer, the surrounding root mat was cut with a knife to limit soil disturbance during the sampling. Cores were covered with plastic foil and stored at 6.C before processing in the lab. [**QUICK DEFINITION OF BD**] The actual soil volume of each core was checked and corrected if necessary prior to weight measurements. We weighted the cores after drying in oven at 105.C, and calculated the bulk density according to the following formula: $\text{Bulk density }(g/cm^3) = \frac{\text{Core dry weight (g)}}{\text{Core volume }(cm^3)}$.
**+ soil moisture**

Bulk density data needed some adjustments due to field and lab constraints. When field sampling was poorly performed because of high roots density, high sand rate or steep slope, the core volume actually filled with soil could be very low. Bulk density estimation being less accurate on low soil volumes, we discarded cores with an estimated volume of soil under 350 cm^3^. A scale dysfunction issues also affected some of our samples during soil weighing. Negative or extreme values were removed. After data filtering, all sites had at least 15 replicates.

### Soil chemistry data

We collected a supplementary soil core in each destructive quadrat for chemical analyses, for a total of 12 cores per site. We used a [**MATERIAL**] core of [**VALUE**] cm diameter and 12 cm depth which was dug into the ground by rotational movements. The soil was stored at 4.C before lab processing. Cores were sieved and merged at the plot level, and 0.5 L was sent to Eurofins for nitrogen and phosphorous quantitative analyses. Total nitrogen content was determined using the Kjedahl method + [**METHOD PHOSPHOROUS**].

### Topographical data

We recorded field slope angle on site with a clinometer, with the observer standing at the highest point and looking down to another observer standing at the lowest point. The mean elevation and the sites coordinates were also collected on the field with a GPS. The aspect degree of the site was determined from geospatial data. An aspect map in degree azimuth of the whole NBR was generated in QGIS (version 3.12.2) from a Digital Elevation Model collected on GeoNorge [**LINK**]. The distance between sites and closest sea bodies was geospatially measured on the map Norge i bilder [**LINK**].

### Landscape data

We collected land cover data on the natural information map Norgeskart [**LINK**] provided by the Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy (NiBIO). Surfaces of land covers including forests, agricultural lands, water bodies and human infrastructures, were retrieved for a buffer zone of 1 km^2^ radius around each field. We simplified the area classification to limit our number of variables: we combined non-managed and managed forests, as well as fully and partially cultivated lands.

### Field management data

Information on the grazing management of each field were collected from the farmers with phone interviews conducted from October 2021 to January 2022 [**SURVEY APPENDIX**]. Three farmers could not or did not want to reply to our survey. We completed the missing values with data from a similar interview series conducted in 2018 [**REF TO MARGIT MASTER THESIS**].

We asked the farmers for the following elements:

- The type of livestock (cow, sheep or goat) which has been grazing the site for at least the past 5 years. There was no mixed-grazing in the fields we selected.
- The size of the flock, including adults and young.
- The number of months the animals stayed on the field
- The total size of the infields
- The size of the field we sampled

Other information related to the farm management are available in Supplementary Information (@tbl-farmermanagement).

The standard calculation of stocking density is made with the following formula [REF]:
$$
\text{Stocking density} = \frac{\text{number of animals}\times{\text{standard livestock unit}}}{\text{surface}\times{\text{grazing period}}}
$$

*Chunk under work*
To estimate the standardised grazing intensity per ha per year on the field, we should have followed the following formula:
Grazing intensity on the field = (number of adults * standard livestock unit + number of young * standard livestock unit)/(field surface * (12/number of months on the field))
Two difficulties here.
Due to rotational grazing management, the period of grazing is not that accurate throughout the years.
Also the flock can also be separated by the farmer and spread into different fields.
Due to missing replies from farmers and the absence of equivalent data in the previous study, we did not have the period of grazing for all sites.
We therefore decided to estimate an average grazing intensity across all grazing fields for each farm.
The formula is as following:
Average grazing intensity on infields = (number of adults * standard livestock unit + number of young * standard livestock unit)/(total grazing area of the farm)
This total grazing area was retrieved from Gårdskart.no, which maps agricultural properties across Norway (NIBIO).
We considered infields but also surrounding unclassified areas which were known from the farmer and/or the field to be grazed.
In two sites, the goats were sent in the summer farms in the mountains for several months in the year.
This was recurring and well described by the farmer.
For these two sites only we therefore decided to keep the first formula.

## Data analysis

*Section under work*

### Data standardisation

All data were summarized at the site level. Beetle abundances of all pitfall traps were summed up. For all the other variables (plant community, soil), the site value was calculated as the average of the sample values.

### Variable colinearity

We checked for variables with a correlation coefficient over 0.7.
When it was possible, we kept the variable with the highest rate of replication within the site.
If the number of replicates was similar, then we chose according to ecological significance.
For soil data, bulk density was strongly correlated with moisture (0.86), LOI (0.8), Humus (0.8) and nitrogen (0.82).

### Linear relationships between variables
We plotted DCA and PCA residuals respectively for plant species and beetle families against each variable.
A straight line close to the x-axis means a linear relationship.
The linearity of the relationship was tested by the Tukey test.

# RESULTS

```


## Interpretation canonical correlations

- strong correlation between the fjord topography and the landscape, but the two sets did not show any correlation with lower scales
- strong correlation between the grazing management and the dominant grass community, but not significant for the forbs or the beetles
- one weakly supported correlation (p<0.1) between grazing management and the fine-scale environment of the beetle assemblage
- strong correlation between the fine-scale environment and the dominant grass community, weaker but still significant for the dominant forb community, not significant for the beetle assemblage
- no set of drivers shows any significant correlation with the beetle assemblage

## Exploration of individual drivers

### Main grass species

```{r VR_grazingxgrass12}
#| label: fig-grazingxgrass12

knitr::include_graphics("outputs/pval_significant/cancor_grazingxgrass_dim23.png")
```

The total infield surface of the farm drives the first axis (@fig-grazingxgrass12), while the livestock types are opposing themselves (sheep in upper left, cow in lower left). *Lolium perenne* would be associated with farms with a high grazing surface. *Poa trivialis* and *Deschampsia cespitosa* would be associated with cow sites (@fig-grazingxgrass23).

```{r VR_locenvixgrass}
#| label: fig-locenvixgrass
#| out-width: "800px"
#| fig-cap: "Visual representation of the canonical correlation between the fine-scale environment and the main grass species community"
#| message: true
#| warning: true
knitr::include_graphics("outputs/pval_significant/cancor_locenvixgrass.png")
```

The first axis is driven by the penetration rate on the right and by the pH on the left (@fig-locenvixgrass). *Deschampsia flexuosa* seems associated with soft soils. The second axis is driven by the mean Phosphorus rate. *Lolium perenne* seems associated with rich soils.

### Main forb species

```{r VR_locenvixforb}
#| label: fig-locenvixforb
#| out-width: "800px"
#| fig-cap: "Visual representation of the canonical correlation between the fine-scale environment and the main forb species community"
#| message: true
#| warning: true
knitr::include_graphics("outputs/pval_significant/cancor_locenvixforb.png")
```

The first axis is also driven by the penetration rate on the right and by the pH on the left (@fig-locenvixforb). *Trifolium repens* seems associated with basic soil. The mean Phosphorus rate is isolated from all the other drivers and all the species on the upper-right corner. Forb species would not be favored by very rich environment.

## Fine-scale environment

```{r VR_grazingxlocenvibeetle}
#| label: fig-grazingxlocenvibeetle
#| out-width: "800px"
#| fig-cap: "Visual representation of the canonical correlation between the grazing management and the fine-scale environment"
#| message: true
#| warning: true
knitr::include_graphics("outputs/pval_significant/cancor_grazingxlocenvi_beetle.png")
```

First axis non-significant but quite clearly driven by livestock type (@fig-grazingxlocenvibeetle). High bryophyte cover seems associated with sheep and goat grazing.

### Influence of fjord system

```{r VR_fjordxlandscape12}
#| label: fig-fjordxlandscape12
#| out-width: "800px"
#| fig-cap: "Visual representation of the canonical correlation between the fjord system and the landscape matrix"
#| message: true

knitr::include_graphics("outputs/pval_significant/cancor_fjordxlandscape_beetle_dim12.png")
```

```{r VR_fjordxlandscape13}
#| label: fig-fjordxlandscape13
#| out-width: "800px"
#| fig-cap: "Visual representation of the canonical correlation between the fjord system and the landscape matrix"
#| message: true
#| warning: true
knitr::include_graphics("outputs/pval_significant/cancor_fjordxlandscape_beetle_dim13.png")
```

The aspect and the distance to sea are driving the first dimension, the slope drives the second dimension and the elevation drives the third dimension. The forest cover would increase inland, with increasing elevation (@fig-fjordxlandscape12, @fig-fjordxlandscape13). On areas with steep slopes, the most important land use around the field would be infields and cultivated lands.

# DISCUSSION

## No correlation between broad-scale variables and community compositions

- For the landscape: as we focused on main species for the plant communities and on main families for the beetle assemblages, We probably lack resolution to be able to detect any effect. If present, forest or wetland specialists would not weight much in the pools and probably be part of the rare species -> low level of replication, low resolution
- influence of broad-scale variables smaller if not invisible at small extent and grain (@siefertScaleDependenceVegetationenvironment2012)

## Fine-scale effect

- Edaphic parameters main drivers of plant species composition (@siefertScaleDependenceVegetationenvironment2012), especially pH (@zelnikPlantSpeciesDiversity2013).
