# ABSTRACT

Pasture-based husbandry has shaped plant and animal communities of high diversity that support multiple ecosystem functions.
However, the direct impact of grazing management on the composition of these communities is not as straightforward, due to complex interactions between management and underlying environmental gradients.
Here we present an attempt at disentangling these interactions across multiple spatial scales in an exploratory study of the agroecological system of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, Western Norway.
We used both canonical correlation analyses and redundancy analyses to investigate
1) links between the regional environment, the landscape matrix, the field management and the fine-scale environment of 29 grazed fields, and
2) links between these factors and dominant grass, forb and dung-associated beetle assemblages.
The composition of the landscape matrix was correlated with the regional environment, showing an increase of land use intensity with closer proximity to fjords.
Dominant grass and forb assemblages were correlated with the fine-scale environment of the grazing fields, according to gradients of vegetation structure and soil resistance to penetration.
Dominant dung-associated beetle assemblages were weakly correlated with the landscape matrix, mostly related to the percent cover of forested areas around the grazing fields.
Relationships involving field management were the least consistent, highlighting the challenge of accurately capturing the independent effect of farming practices in small-scale grazing systems.

Keywords: agroecology; livestock; semi-natural grassland; plant community; dung beetle community

# HIGHLIGHTS

- We performed the first analysis of cross-scale interactions between environmental gradients, grazing management and community composition in the agroecological landscape of the fjord region of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, Western Norway.

- Land use at landscape-scale was more affected by the distance to the closest fjord than regional gradients of temperature and precipitation.

- The strongest edaphic predictor of dominant grass and forb assemblages was soil resistance to penetration, while soil moisture and nutrient availability showed only negligible contribution.

- Dung-associated beetle assemblages, which were dominated by the Staphylinidae family, were more affected by landscape-scale factors than local-scale factors.

- Using standard grazing indicators and fields as the unit of assessment showed limitations in capturing the inherent spatiotemporal variability of rotational management. Nevertheless, our approach helped untangle some of the interactions operating between spatial scales, improving our understanding of small-scale grazing systems.

# INTRODUCTION

Plant and animal communities of semi-natural grasslands are the result of a long history of management involving mutual interactions between human, domestic grazers and the local environment [@denglerBiodiversityPalaearcticGrasslands2014; @ellisLandUseEcological2021].
These communities have ensured the long-term production of livestock, either by directly supplying the forage resource (e.g. grasses, forbs) [@collombCorrelationFattyAcids2002; @frenchSpeciesCompositionDetermines2017], or by supporting forage provision through for instance nutrient cycling (e.g. dung-associated beetles, soil fauna) [@bardgettBelowgroundBiodiversityEcosystem2014; @nicholsEcologicalFunctionsEcosystem2008].
In Europe, recent research has shown how agricultural intensification has led to the simplification of semi-natural grassland communities, and the subsequent negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning [@allanLandUseIntensification2015; @schilsPermanentGrasslandsEurope2022].
However, in low-intensity grazing systems, effects of management on plant and animal communities are not as consistent [@scohierHowSheepAffect2012; @wangGlobalMetaanalysesResponse2019], and the influence of underlying environmental gradients is stronger [@denglerBiodiversityPalaearcticGrasslands2014].
Disentangling these interactions is therefore necessary to understand to what extent farmers can affect the productivity and diversity of their fields [@redlichDisentanglingEffectsClimate2022].

The influences of environmental gradients and management on plant and animal communities in semi-natural grasslands operate across multiple spatial scales [@denglerBiodiversityPalaearcticGrasslands2014; @petersCrossScaleInteractions2007].
At the regional scale, variation in climate and elevation generates gradients of abiotic stress and resource availability, affecting species distribution through habitat filtering and mitigating biotic interactions within communities [@conradiResourceAvailabilityDetermines2017; @fridleyLongerGrowingSeasons2016; @klanderudImportanceBioticVs2015].
The resulting patterns of primary productivity determine ecosystems' resilience to disturbance, and by extension their capacity for sustaining different types of land use [@piipponenGlobalTrendsGrassland2022].
At the landscape scale, connectivity between semi-natural habitats contributes to the diversification of species pools [@billeterIndicatorsBiodiversityAgricultural2007; @zulkaSpeciesRichnessDry2014] and ensures the stability of functional networks [@fantinatoCooccurrenceDifferentGrassland2019; @neffCrossscaleEffectsLand2019].
Agricultural intensification disrupts species migration and the continuity of the landscape matrix, leading to the simplification of natural communities and their ecological interactions [@kareivaConnectingLandscapePatterns1995; @leprovostContrastingResponsesBelowground2021; @seiboldArthropodDeclineGrasslands2019].
At the field scale, the strongest selective pressure usually comes from land use [@neffCrossscaleEffectsLand2019] and varies in direction and magnitude according to the type and intensity of the management [@gaujourFactorsProcessesAffecting2012].
In grazing systems, multiple factors such as stocking density, grazer selectivity or fertilisation can affect species dominance by favouring competitive or ruderal strategies [@koernerChangeDominanceDetermines2018; @olffEffectsHerbivoresGrassland1998].
Manure deposition and animal excreta also support the activity of a diversified coprophilous beetle community [@daoudiCompositionPhenologyBeetle2022; @sigsgaardEnvironmentalDNAMetabarcoding2021], which facilitates the nutrient cycling process between the livestock, the soil and the vegetation [@nicholsEcologicalFunctionsEcosystem2008].
Lastly, the fine-scale environment in the fields, including gradients of topographic (e.g. slope angle, aspect), edaphic (e.g. soil moisture, bulk density, nutrient availability) and biotic (e.g. vegetation height, litter cover) parameters, determines the resources availability for the plant community [@fayGrasslandProductivityLimited2015; @klimekPlantSpeciesRichness2007] and arthropod ecological niches [@broseBottomupControlCarabid2003; @coleInfluenceFinescaleHabitat2010].
Some factors, such as topography, are inherent to the local context, while other factors such as soil physicochemical properties or vegetation structure are also influenced by management. 
For instance, livestock trampling and grazing affecting soil compaction and vegetation height respectively [@mayelHowDoesGrassland2021; @zhangSoilPhysicalChemical2019].

A suitable framework for investigating cross-scale interactions within agroecological systems is the UNESCO World Network of Biosphere Reserves (WNBR) and its associated Man and Biosphere (MAB) program [@unescoManBiosphereProgramme2025; @unescoNewRoadmapMan2017], which offer a platform of international collaboration and knowledge-sharing for the regional implementation of the Agenda 2030 Sustainable Development Goals [@barracloughGlobalKnowledgeAction2023; @unitednationsTransformingOurWorld2015].
In Western Norway, the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve epitomises the agroecological landscape of the fjord region [@kalandNordhordlandBiosphereReserve2018], which has been shaped by a long history of small-scale farming and livestock grazing [@austadHumaninfluencedVegetationTypes1991; @hjelleLongtermChangesRegional2018].
The Nordhordland small-scale grazing systems include different types of farm structure, ranging from extensive sheep and goat farming to more production-oriented mixed dairy-beef systems [@potthoffNorwegianLowintensityOvine2023].
Farmers usually rely on rotational grazing to limit the stocking density on individual fields and allow grasslands to recover [@indrelidFarmingSystemIts1988].
These different management practices would be expected to generate taxonomic and/or functional divergences in plant and animal communities of semi-natural grasslands [@boavistaEffectsGrazingRegimes2019; @lenoirEffectsTimingGrazing2010; @tothLivestockTypeMore2016].
However, the agroecological system of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve is also characterised by strong environmental gradients associated with the fjord context, including oceanity, topography and climate [@nesjeFjordsNorwayComplex2009].
In these circumstances, the structure and composition of communities are likely to be affected by multiple interactions between grazing management and different levels of environmental variation, which, to our knowledge, have yet to be investigated in the agroecological landscapes of the fjord region.

In this study, we relied on a spatially-explicit approach to explore (1) links between field management and environmental gradients and (2) their respective influences on dominant assemblages of semi-natural grasslands in the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.
We classified the explanatory factors into four main spatial scales, based on a conceptual representation of the small-scale grazing systems in the fjord region of Western Norway (@fig-fjordconcept):
the **regional scale**, representing the climate and landform gradient associated with the fjord context; 
the **landscape scale**, related to the composition of the landscape matrix surrounding the grazing fields; 
the **field scale**, characterising the grazing management of the field; 
and finally the **fine scale**, including variables related to vegetation and soil structure, topography and nutrients.
We selected grass three indicator communities in relation to their key contributions to forage provision in semi-natural grasslands:
grass and forb species, as direct determinant of forage availability and nutritional quality;
and dung-associated beetle families, as indirect support of forage production through their role in the nutrient cycling process.

# MATERIAL AND METHODS

## Study area

The Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve is located in the fjord region of Western Norway, between the Bergen region to the south and the Sognefjord, Europe's deepest and longest fjord, to the north [@kalandNordhordlandBiosphereReserve2018]. 
The area is characterised by strong elevation and climate gradients from west to east, with average July temperature dropping from 15.9 to 8.3°C and annual precipitation increasing from 1550 to 4800 mm [@ketzlerClimateNorway2021; @meteorologiskinstituttNorskKlimaservicesenter2023]. 

In the summers of 2019 and 2020, we conducted an ecological survey on 29 grazing fields distributed across the southern part of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, all located below 250 m above sea level (@fig-sitemap).
Our sites were "infields" (*innmarksbeite*), defined by the Norwegian AR5 land cover classification system as "*agricultural land that cannot be harvested mechanically* \[with\] *at least 50% of the area* \[...\] *covered with cultured grass or pasture-tolerant herbs*" [@ahlstromAR5Klassifikasjonssystem2019]. 
All fields had been grazed uninterruptedly for at least 10 years, and had been grazed by the same livestock type, either sheep, goats or cattle, for at least the last 5 years. 
According to the farmers, most fields had been continuously grazed for at least 50 years; 
three had short gaps in their grazing history (5 years or under), and one had a long gap (20 years). 
Grazing intensity was low, with a maximum stocking rate of 0.6 yearly unit per ha. 
Twenty-one sites were enriched at least occasionally with individual or simultaneous use of artificial fertiliser, manure or shellsand-lime mix. 
To the knowledge of the farmers, no field had been resown and/or plowed since at least the 1970s, and only four out of the 29 sites received upgraded drainage between 1990 and 2010.

## Data collection

We visited each of the 29 sites once, starting in mid-June at the westernmost sites and ending in late July at the easternmost sites to account for the spring bloom time difference [@karlsenVariabilityStartGrowing2007]. 
On each site, we laid out a nested sampling design within a representative area of 400 m^2^, preferentially 20 m x 20 m but when necessary 40 m x 10 m, avoiding rocks, waterlogged ground, trees and field edges.
According to the same exclusion rules, we set three plots of 3 m x 3 m in the sampling area, at least 6 m apart from each other (@fig-sampling). 
Each plot was divided into nine subplots of 1 m^2^, five of them dedicated to non-destructive plant community observations, and the remaining four used for destructive sampling of the dung-associated beetle community and soil.

![Schematic representation of the nested sampling design applied in a representative area of each site. Field sampling was carried out on the same day except for beetle trapping.

### Grass, forb and dung-associated beetle assemblages

In each non-destructive subplot (15 per site), all plant species were identified using the Nordic flora [@mossbergGyldendalsStoreNordiske2018] and attributed an average percent cover by one of the same two observers.
When necessary, specimens were collected, coded and brought for microscopic or expert identification.
We determined the average percent cover of bare ground, rock and litter, and estimated average vegetation height out of three random measurements within the subplot.

In each destructive subplot (12 per site), we collected dung-associated beetles with dung-baited pitfall traps set for one full week between early July and early August.
Traps were made of white plastic cups of 1 L (diam. 10.5 cm, height 11.5 cm) filled to 1/4 with salted water, with a drop of neutral detergent to break water surface tension. 
The cups were covered with a square metal grid of 2 cm x 2 cm mesh size pegged into the ground, on which we put a ball of about fist size of previously-frozen cattle dung.
The dung ball was placed at the centre of the grid, at least 3 cm from the edge of the cup to provide enough space for beetles to fall in.
Beetles were stored in 70% ethanol and identified to the family level using the identification key from @duffBeetlesBritainIreland2012a.
The sampling design resulted in a spatial clumping of pitfall traps, but it was not deemed to cause spatial autocorrelation or affect our abundance data [@bakerEvaluatingSpatialAutocorrelation2006; @wardEffectsPitfallTrap2001].

### Soil data

We characterised soil structure using three complementary measurements: 
soil resistance to penetration, induced by root mat density and soil texture; 
bulk density, as a proxy for soil compaction;
and gravimetric water content, indicating water holding capacity. 
We measured soil resistance to penetration twice in each destructive subplot (24 per site), by dropping a sharpened metal rod of 43.4 cm length (diam. 2.2 cm; weight 1.3 kg) from 1 m above ground through a PVC tube to ensure vertical fall. 
The visible standing part of the stick was measured and subtracted from the total stick length to obtain the length of penetration into the soil. 
Before dropping the stick, the surrounding vegetation around a 5 cm radius was cleared to prevent resistance from the aboveground vegetation. 
The tip was regularly sharpened and remeasured to account for the decrease in length, which was of 1.6 % (0.7 cm) by the end of the sampling season.

For bulk density and gravimetric water content, we sampled three soil cores with PVC tubes of 57.23 cm^3^ (diam. 3.7 cm, height 10 cm) in each destructive subplot (36 per site). 
To limit soil compression during collection, we sharpened the edges of the PVC tubes and cut the surrounding root mat with a knife while pushing down the cores. 
Samples were covered with plastic foil and stored at 6°C before processing in the lab. 
If necessary, the soil volume of each core was corrected for holes or unfilled space prior to weighing.
We discarded cores with less than 50 cm^3^ of soil to prevent inaccurate measurements of bulk density and soil moisture, which represented approx. 20% of the total collected cores.

Gravimetric water content is calculated as the difference in proportion between the soil moist weight and the soil dry weight, and bulk density as the soil dry weight related to its volume:


$$
\text{Gravimetric water content}\; (\%) = \frac{\text{Core moist weight}\;(g) - \text{Core dry weight}\;(g)}{\text{Core moist weight}\;(g)}*100
$$

$$
\text{Bulk density}\;(g/cm^3) = \frac{\text{Core dry weight}\;(g)}{\text{Core volume}\;(cm^3)}
$$

Moist weight is usually measured from freshly sampled soil.
However, as weather conditions varied considerably during our sampling period, we standardised the measurement by weighing soil 48h after water saturation in the laboratory. 
Dry weight was obtained after 24h of drying in the oven at 105°C. 
After data filtering of low volumes and some negative values linked to a weighing balance dysfunction during lab processing, all sites had at least 9 measurements of bulk density and gravimetric water content each.

For chemical analyses, we sampled soil with a stainless steel cylindrical core of 200 cm^3^ (diam. 10.5 cm; height 12 cm) in each destructive subplot. 
The soil was stored at 4°C before being sieved and merged at the plot level (3 per site).
We sent 0.5 L of each pooled sample to a certified analysis laboratory to determine total nitrogen content with modified Kjeldahl method (NS-EN 13654-1:2890) [@bremnerDeterminationNitrogenSoil1960], and available phosphorus concentration with ammonium lactacte extraction method [@brayDeterminationTotalOrganic1945].

lm_oceanity <- lm(maxtempJuly-mintempJan ~ EPSG.25832_X, data = oceanity)
summary_oceanity <- summary(lm_oceanity)

```

On site, we recorded field coordinates (SCR EPSG:25832), elevation, and field slope angle with a compass clinometer. 
We determined slope aspect degree and distance to the closest fjord from a Digital Elevation Model of 10 m x 10 m cell size retrieved from the GeoNorge online map catalogue of the Norwegian Mapping Authority [@kartverketGeoNorgeKartkatalogen2023]. 
Average annual precipitation, maximum and average July temperatures, and minimum and average January temperatures, were obtained from 1 km^2^ daily projections provided by the Norwegian Centre for Climate Services over the period 2010-2020 [@wongGridded112016]. 
Average annual temperature range, calculated as the difference between maximum July temperature and minimum January temperature, showed a strong linear relationship with longitude (adjusted R^2^ = `r op(summary_oceanity$adj.r.squared, 2)`, F = `r op(summary_oceanity$fstatistic[1], 0)`, p-value = `r op(summary_oceanity$coefficients[2,4], 3)`) and was used as a proxy for oceanity.
For sites not covered by the daily projections, data were extrapolated from averaging values of neighbouring cells with the R software package *terra* (v. 1.7.29) [@hijmansTerraSpatialData2023; @rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2024].

### Landscape matrix data

We calculated land use percent cover in a 1 km radius area around each field from land cover data provided by the Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research (NIBIO) [@norskinstituttforbiookonominibioKildenArealinformasjon2023].
Land cover was categorised according to the AR5 land cover classification system [@ahlstromAR5Klassifikasjonssystem2019], that we simplified into eight categories:
forest area, including managed and non-managed; 
cultivated area, either fully or partially; 
infield area, i.e. enclosed, productive grazing area (permanent grasslands); 
outfield area, i.e. unenclosed, low-productivity grazing area (shrublands or heathlands); 
wetland area; 
artificial area.

### Field management data

We conducted phone interviews with 23 farmers from October 2021 to January 2022 to collect information on field management. 
For the 3 out of 26 farmers who were unable or unwilling to reply to our survey, we used data from a similar interview series conducted in 2018 [@reiersenBaerekraftVestnorskLandbruk2019]. 
We asked the farmers for the following elements: 
the type of livestock which has been grazing the site for the past 5 years; 
the size of the flock, including adults and young; 
the grazing period on the visited field; 
the total surface area of infields grazed by the animals on the farm; 
the size of the grazing field we selected as a survey site.

Stocking density is usually calculated as follows: 

$$
\text{Stocking density} = \frac{\text{number animals}\times{\text{standard livestock unit}}}{\text{area}\times{\text{grazing period}}}
$$ 

However, estimating stocking density for individual fields was challenging, as  most respondents could not give us accurate field occupation periods due to the regular transfers of livestock during the season.
We thus arranged the formula to calculate instead an average stocking density for the farms' total infield area over a year:

$$
\text{Average stocking density} = \frac{\text{Nadults}\times{\text{standard  LU}} + \text{Nyoung}\times{\text{young LU}} }{\text{total infield area of the farm}}
$$ 

We defined the reference livestock unit (LU) for young sheep and goats as half the value of adult (0.05 LU). 
The total infield area within each farm was retrieved from the map of agricultural properties made by the Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research (https://gardskart.nibio.no/). 
We included both areas classified as infields (*innmark*) and unclassified areas which were known as grazing fields from the farmer and/or from field observation. 
For two farms (IG1 and IG2) where livestock was moved to mountain summer farms every year, we calculated average stocking density for the time period when animals were in the lowlands.

## Data analysis

We first used canonical correlation analysis, which searches for the maximum correlation between linear projections of two datasets [@hotellingRelationsTwoSets1992], to investigate 1) links between sets of explanatory variables characterising the regional environment, the landscape matrix, field management and the fine-scale environment of semi-natural grasslands, and 2) links between these explanatory sets and dominant grass, forb and dung-associated beetle assemblages (following scheme in @fig-fjordconcept).
We then used redundancy analysis (RDA) [@legendreNumericalEcology2012] to get insight into the effect of individual variables and assess robustness of the results.

Prior to analyses, we averaged all data from the nested sampling design at the site level.
We standardised all explanatory variables (environmental gradients and grazing management variables) to 0 mean and standard deviation 1.
We further checked and filtered all variables, removing variables with highly skewed distributions or with obvious outliers, and secondly by testing variable collinearity within each set with the Spearman's rank correlation test. 
For a correlation coefficient of 0.8 or higher, variables were selected first according to the highest within-site replication, and second according to the most even distribution.
We found high collinearity between average January temperature and annual temperature range (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.93), and between bulk density, gravimetric water content, loss of ignition, total nitrogen content and humus content (Spearman's rank correlation coefficients ranging from 0.78 to 1).
The variables kept for the canonical correlation analysis are shown in @fig-fjordconcept and their statistical summary can be found in @tbl-varsum.

Assemblage data were percent cover for grass (Poaceae) and forb species, and abundance for beetle families. 
We filtered taxa according to their frequency and abundance across sites: 
species or families found in at least one-third of the infields, with a minimum average percent cover of 1% for plants and a minimum average occurrence of 3 for beetles, were selected for the analysis. 
In total, eight species of grasses, seven species of forbs and five families of beetles were selected (@fig-fjordconcept). 
Community data were transformed using Hellinger transformation, which lowers the weight of variables with low counts and many zeros [@borcardNumericalEcology2011; @legendreEcologicallyMeaningfulTransformations2001].

We tested for statistical significance of correlations with asymptotic approximation of Hotelling-Lawley Trace (*p.asym* function in CCP package) [@mullerPracticalMethodsComputing1984], and statistical significance of RDA models, axes and terms by ANOVA-like permutation (n = 999) [@legendreTestingSignificanceCanonical2011; @legendreNumericalEcology2012].
For illustrative purpose, we performed RDAs on all combinations of sets and provided them in Supplementary Information.

All statistical analyses were performed in R (v.4.4.1) with R-Studio (v.2024.04.2+764) [@positteamRStudioIntegratedDevelopment2024; @rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2024]. 
The canonical correlation analyses and the related statistical tests were made with the *CCA* [@gonzalezCCACanonicalCorrelation2023] and *CCP* [@menzelCCPSignificanceTests2022] packages. 
The redundancy analyses were performed with the *vegan* package [@oksanenVeganCommunityEcology2024] and their visual representations were made with the *ggord* package [@beckGgordOrdinationPlots2022].

## Cross-scale interactions between environmental gradients and management

The landscape matrix was significantly correlated with the regional environment, with a correlation coefficient rho of `r op(envar$rho[1], 2)` (F approximation of Hotelling-Lawley trace F~30,82~ = `r op(envar$approx[1], 2)`, p-value = `r op(envar$p.value[1], 3)`) (@fig-cancorenvi; @tbl-cancorenv) and an adjusted R^2^ of `r op(rdastat_envi$adj.r.squared[1], 2)` (F~5~ = `r op(rdastat_envi$F[1], 2)`, p-value = `r op(rdastat_envi$PrF[1], 3)`) (@tbl-rdaregio).
The first axis of the RDA model was significant (F = `r op(rdastat_envi$F[3], 2)`, p-value = `r op(rdastat_envi$PrF[3], 3)`) and mainly driven by fjord proximity (F = `r op(rdastat_envi$F[9], 2)`, p-value = `r op(rdastat_envi$PrF[9], 3)`), which was associated with a decrease of forest and outfield areas and an increase of cultivated and infield areas (@fig-rdaregiolandscape).

The relationship between field management and the fine-scale environment was found significant in the redundancy analysis only, with the RDA model explaining a low proportion of variance (R~adj~^2^ = `r op(rdastat_envi$adj.r.squared[48], 2)`, F~4~ = `r op(rdastat_envi$F[48], 2)`, p-value = `r op(rdastat_envi$PrF[48], 3)`) (@fig-cancor A; @tbl-rdafield).
The first axis of the RDA model was marginally significant (F = `r op(rdastat_envi$F[51], 2)`, p-value = `r op(rdastat_envi$PrF[51], 3)`) and mostly driven by livestock type (F = `r op(rdastat_envi$F[52], 2)`, p-value = `r op(rdastat_envi$PrF[52], 3)`) and field area (F = `r op(rdastat_envi$F[54], 2)`, p-value = `r op(rdastat_envi$PrF[54], 3)`), with bigger fields and/or fields grazed by sheep weakly associated with higher cover of bryophytes, more compact soil and lower vegetation height (@fig-rdafieldfine).

## Influence of the environmental gradients and management on dominant grass, forb and dung-associated beetle assemblages

According to the canonical correlation analyses, dominant grass assemblages were significantly correlated with the fine-scale environment (rho = `r op(comvar$rho[4], 2)`, F~56,86~ = `r op(comvar$approx[4], 2)`, p-value = `r op(comvar$p.value[4], 3)`) and the regional environment (rho = `r op(comvar$rho[1], 2)`, F~35,77~ = `r op(comvar$approx[1], 2)`, p-value = `r op(comvar$p.value[1], 3)`), and marginally correlated with the field management (rho = `r op(comvar$rho[3], 2)`, F~28,66~ = `r op(comvar$approx[3], 2)`, p-value = `r op(comvar$p.value[3], 3)`) (@fig-cancorgrass; @tbl-cancorcom).
However, only the fine-scale environment explained a significant proportion of the grass assemblage variance in the corresponding redundancy analysis (R~adj~^2^ = `r op(rdastat_grass$adj.r.squared[28], 2)`, F~8~ = `r op(rdastat_grass$F[28], 2)`, p-value = `r op(rdastat_grass$PrF[28], 3)`) (@tbl-rdagrass).
The first axis was significant (F = `r op(rdastat_grass$F[30], 2)`, p-value = `r op(rdastat_grass$PrF[30], 3)`) and essentially driven by a gradient of vegetation structure, with increasing vegetation height in one direction along the axis (F = `r op(rdastat_grass$F[33], 2)`, p-value = `r op(rdastat_grass$PrF[33], 3)`) and increasing bryophyte cover in the opposite direction (F = `r op(rdastat_grass$F[32], 2)`, p-value = `r op(rdastat_grass$PrF[32], 3)`) (@fig-rdafinegrass).
*Deschampsia cespitosa* and *Holcus lanatus* were associated with taller vegetation, while at the opposite end *Poa pratensis* was associated with higher bryophyte cover.
The second axis was marginally significant (F = `r op(rdastat_grass$F[31], 2)`, p-value = `r op(rdastat_grass$PrF[31], 3)`) and represented an edaphic gradient linking high soil acidity (F = `r op(rdastat_grass$F[36], 2)`, p-value = `r op(rdastat_grass$PrF[36], 3)`) with low resistance to penetration (F = `r op(rdastat_grass$F[37], 2)`, p-value = `r op(rdastat_grass$PrF[37], 3)`). 
*Deschampsia flexuosa* was associated with softer and more acidic soils, while *Festuca rubra* and *Holcus lanatus* were associated with greater soil resistance to penetration and lower acidity level.

The fine-scale environment was also correlated with dominant forb assemblages, with a correlation coefficient rho of `r op(comvar$rho[9], 2)` (F~56,86~ = `r op(comvar$approx[9], 2)`, p-value = `r op(comvar$p.value[9], 3)`) (@fig-cancorforb; @tbl-cancorcom).
The fine-scale environment explained `r op(rdastat_forb$adj.r.squared[28]*100)`% of the forb assemblage variance (RDA model: F~8~ = `r op(rdastat_forb$F[28], 2)`, p-value = `r op(rdastat_forb$PrF[28], 3)`) (@tbl-rdaforb). 
The first axis was significant (F = `r op(rdastat_forb$F[30], 2)`, p-value = `r op(rdastat_forb$PrF[30], 3)`) and mainly driven by soil penetration (F = `r op(rdastat_forb$F[37], 2)`, p-value = `r op(rdastat_forb$PrF[37], 3)`), which was inversely related to soil pH and available phosphorus concentration (@fig-rdafineforb).
*Potentilla erecta* and *Galium saxatile* were associated with softer and more acidic soils, while *Ranunculus acris* and *Trifolium repens* were associated with stronger soil resistance to penetration and lower acidity level.
The gradient of vegetation structure was represented by the second axis, non-significant (F = `r op(rdastat_forb$F[31], 2)`, p-value = `r op(rdastat_forb$PrF[31], 3)`).
Average vegetation height was the most important factor (F = `r op(rdastat_forb$F[33], 2)`, p-value = `r op(rdastat_forb$PrF[33], 2)`), with *Trifolium repens* associated with shorter vegetation (@fig-rdafineforb).

According to the canonical correlation analyses, dung-associated beetle assemblages were significantly correlated with the regional environment (rho = `r op(comvar$rho[11], 2)`, F~25,87~ = `r op(comvar$approx[11], 2)`, p-value = `r op(comvar$p.value[11], 3)`), the landscape matrix (rho = `r op(comvar$rho[12], 2)`, F~30,82~ = `r op(comvar$approx[12], 2)`, p-value = `r op(comvar$p.value[12], 3)`) and the field management (rho = `r op(comvar$rho[13], 2)`, F~20,74~ = `r op(comvar$approx[13], 2)`, p-value = `r op(comvar$p.value[13], 3)`) (@fig-cancorbeetle; @tbl-cancorcom). 
However, none of the corresponding RDA models were significant, and only the landscape matrix explained a fair share of variance (R~adj~^2^ = `r op(rdastat_beetle$adj.r.squared[10], 2)`, F~6~ = `r op(rdastat_beetle$F[10], 2)`, p-value = `r op(rdastat_beetle$PrF[10], 3)`) (@tbl-rdabeetle).
The first axis was essentially driven by the proportion of forested areas (F = `r op(rdastat_beetle$F[15], 2)`, p-value = `r op(rdastat_beetle$PrF[15], 3)`), which was associated with a higher relative abundance of Carabidae and Hydrophilidae (@fig-rdalandscapebeetle).

# DISCUSSION

Among the complexity of the cross-scale interactions in the small-scale grazing systems of Western Norway, we were able to identify some links between environmental gradients, land use and dominant plant and dung-associated beetle assemblages of semi-natural grasslands.
The composition of the landscape matrix of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve was influenced by the geography of the fjord region, with an increase of more intensively managed areas such as infields and croplands towards the nearest fjord shorelines.
Plant assemblages were correlated with the fine-scale environment and responded to gradients of soil penetration and of vegetation structure.
For dung-associated beetle assemblages, landscape-scale factors explained the highest proportion of variance.
However, we found no clear evidence of an effect of field management on the fine-scale environment or on dominant plant and beetle assemblages of the grazing fields.

## Fjord geography influences land use at landscape scale

We expected the regional environment of the fjord region to influence land use due to strong west-east gradients of climate and landform affecting plant phenology and soil fertility [@karlsenVariabilityStartGrowing2007; @uttakleivLandskapskartleggingNorgeLandscape2011].
However, our findings suggest that, within the investigated range, the environmental context at the individual fjord level has a stronger influence on landscape composition than the broader oceanity and elevation gradients.
Local communities relied on both land and water resources to ensure their livelihood, using the fjords not only for fishing but also for the transport of livestock and people [@brekkeKulturhistoriskVegbokHordaland1993; @hetlandPluriactivityStrategyEmployment1986].
Crops and hay-meadows were thus mostly cultivated and managed along the fjords and fjord arms, while less-accessible grasslands and shrublands were used for extensive grazing [@indrelidFarmingSystemIts1988; @olssonAgroecosystemsNeolithicTime1991].
During the post-WW2 agricultural transition, outermost areas were abandoned or converted for the development of the forestry industry, while livestock was moved to more fertile areas [@fjellstadPatternsChangeTwo1999; @hamreLandcoverStructuralChanges2007].
Our study thus shows how the agroecological landscape reflects land use history and the evolution of the socioeconomic context in the fjord region [@beleHeritageBoundariesNatureculture2024].

However, we cannot determine whether this pattern is correlated with the productivity of the grazing fields, as we observed no clear link between the regional environment and dominant plant communities [see also @demeauxJustGrazeIt2024].
Inconsistent outcomes between our canonical correlation analyses and redundancy analyses may suggest the existence of more complex non-linear interactions, which could only be captured with more a robust analytical framework [@dixonhamilCrossscaleContradictionsEcological2016; @petersCrossScaleInteractions2007; @redlichDisentanglingEffectsClimate2022].
The sensitivity of our analysis to broader gradients was also probably limited by the spatial range of our study area (approximately 900 km^2^), for which local climatic and topographic variables could have stronger influence than regional processes [@siefertScaleDependenceVegetationenvironment2012].
As our exploratory study suggests a role of the fjord environmental context in determining land use, it would be relevant to investigate more thoroughly the cross-scale processes in the agroecological systems of Western Norway in the current context of climate and land use changes [@bardgettCombattingGlobalGrassland2021; @kremenLandscapesThatWork2018].

## Plant assemblages determined by the fine-scale environment of grazing fields

Only the fine-scale environment explained a significant proportion of variance in dominant plant assemblages, rather than factors associated with the regional environment, the landscape matrix or the field management [@klimekPlantSpeciesRichness2007].
Interestingly, the most important edaphic predictor was not soil moisture [@merunkovaEnvironmentalControlSpecies2012; @zelnikPlantSpeciesDiversity2013] or nutrient availability [@critchleyAssociationLowlandGrassland2002; @klimekPlantSpeciesRichness2007], but soil resistance to penetration.
Furthermore, soil resistance to penetration was independent from bulk density and systematically paired with a pH gradient, suggesting a greater contribution of biological factors (e.g. plant roots) compared with soil physical properties [@forsterRootTraitsCrop2022; @kumiQuantifyingRootinducedSoil2023].
Lower resistance on more acidic soils could be explained by the increased concentration of ammonium [@brittoNH4ToxicityHigher2002; @kleijnSearchKeyBiogeochemical2008] and ionic aluminium [@halingRootMorphologyRoothair2010; @kochianCellularMechanismsAluminum1995], which inhibit plant root growth and would thus lessen the resistance driven by the root mat [@forsterRootTraitsCrop2022]. 
However, experimental acidification in grasslands showed instead an increase of root density following a community shift from forbs to perennial grasses [@chenBioticCommunityShifts2015; @wangSoilAcidificationAlters2020]. 
We cannot extrapolate further on this soil acidity-resistance relationship without direct assessment of root length/density and standardised measurement of soil resistance to penetration [@sojkaSituStrengthBulk2001], but this interaction would be worth investigating further.

Grass and forb assemblages also responded to vegetation height, and to a lesser extent bryophyte cover, suggesting an underlying gradient of field productivity [@olffEffectsHerbivoresGrassland1998; @vanderwalMossesStruggleLight2005].
The tall and unpalatable *Deschampsia cespitosa* probably contributed to increase average vegetation height when dominant.
However, the negative correlation between vegetation height and bryophyte cover shows that potential confounding effects are negligible.
Slope steepness was consistently, though not significantly, associated with this gradient of vegetation structure, suggesting that local topography could influence plant height and species composition through nutrient and/or water availability [@kleinebeckerEffectsGrazingSeasonal2011].
In an extensive study of meadow communities in Western Norway, @losvikHayMeadowCommunities1993 observed a clear divergence between drier, well-drained fields, and wetter, flat fields.
Considering the ongoing land use changes in the region, it would be relevant to replicate @losvikHayMeadowCommunities1993's work to assess whether the relative influences of topographic, biotic and edaphic factors have changed in the intervening years.

## Dung-associated beetle families affected by the composition of the landscape matrix

Landscape-scale factors had a greater influence on beetle assemblages compared with local-scale and fine-scale factors, which is consistent with previous findings [@liuFunctionalBeetleDiversity2014; @schweigerQuantifyingImpactEnvironmental2005].
The most important landscape-scale driver for beetle communities is usually connectivity between semi-natural habitats [e.g. @burelDifferentialResponseSelected2004; @schweigerQuantifyingImpactEnvironmental2005].
In Western Norway, the connectivity of semi-natural habitats in the agricultural landscape is not as strongly disrupted by land use intensification compared with flatter and more productive regions [@cusensParticipatoryMappingReveals2022; @fjellstadPatternsChangeTwo1999].
Forest patches are instead expected to be a source of woodland specialists, which could have increased the relative abundance of Carabidae and Hydrophilidae in nearvy grazing fields [@avironCarabidAssemblagesAgricultural2005; @vanbergenEffectLanduseHeterogeneity2005].
This hypothesis should however be verified with a more thorough investigation of the dung-associated beetle community which, interestingly, was strongly dominated by Staphylinidae [see also @daoudiCompositionPhenologyBeetle2022].
The weak contribution of Scarabaeidae (only 2.5% of our total catches) shows how limited assessments solely based on typical "dung beetle" taxa (i.e. Scarabaeinae, Aphodiinae, Scarabaeidae or Geotrupidae) are, particularly in the Nordic region where Scarabaeinae and Aphodiinae are poorly represented [@artsdatabankenArtsdatabankenKunnskapsbankNaturmangfold2023].
Comprehensive investigations of the coprophilous community are challenging to accomplish in short-term studies, but can be facilitated by trait-based approaches [e.g. @tonelliEffectsProgressiveAbandonment2018], as well as DNA-based methods [e.g. @sigsgaardEnvironmentalDNAMetabarcoding2021] which are becoming increasingly accessible and reliable.

## Indirect effect of field management on plant assemblages?

We found no clear evidence of the direct influence of field management on dominant plant and beetle assemblages in the semi-natural grasslands of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.
However, we observed a weak relationship between field management and the fine-scale environment, in which sheep grazing and small field area were positively associated with bryophyte cover and negatively related to vegetation height.
This finding could reflect an indirect link between field management and dominant grass assemblages, which were significantly correlated with the same gradient of vegetation structure.
On the one hand, a well-developed bryophyte layer could indicate a lower trampling pressure and/or a weaker competition for light under sheep grazing, subsequently affecting species dominance in the plant community [@ludvikovaLongTermDefoliation2014; @olffEffectsHerbivoresGrassland1998].
On the other hand, it could reflect an inherently low field productivity, which would lead the farmers to conduct more extensive sheep grazing [@demeauxJustGrazeIt2024].
Regardless, these results suggest that current farming practices in the semi-natural grasslands of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve do not override the inherent variation in plant communities driven by the fine-scale environment.

## Optimising methodological frameworks for small-scale grazing systems

Overall, our study is quite representative of how challenging ecological assessments of small-scale grazing systems are in observational studies, particularly when rotational management is involved.
While in theory a *certain number of animals* is allocated on a *certain area of land* for a *certain period of time*, farmers continuously adapt their management to unforeseeable circumstances, such as for instance the livestock birth rate/survival or the timing of spring bloom [@nuthallIntuitiveWorldFarmers2012].
We witnessed it firsthand during our interviews, as the farmers themselves struggled to provide accurate grazing schedules for a single field.
These shortcomings led us to question how to address the inherent variability of small-scale farming systems in multivariate ecological studies [@sinclairOptionsContextApproach2019], as the replication level required for robust variance partitioning analyses is only met in wide-scale collaborative projects [e.g. Biodiversity Exploratories, see @fischerImplementingLargescaleLongterm2010].
Scaling up the study design from a single representative field to the whole farm matrix, and developing novel indicators based on a mosaic concept, could provide a better analytical framework for capturing the transfers of energy and livestock between fields [@deffontainesAgriculturalSystemsLandscape1995; @kokEuropeanBiodiversityAssessments2020].
Such a strategy would also facilitate the application of ecological research through the experimentation of more innovative, transdisciplinary approaches and concepts [@lacombeDesigningAgroecologicalFarming2018; @wittmanSocialEcologicalPerspective2017], such as farm multifunctionality [@kremenLandscapesThatWork2018; @wilsonWeakStrongMultifunctionality2008] or life cycle assessments [@kokEuropeanBiodiversityAssessments2020].
Farmers are particularly crucial partners to involve during the research process as
(1) knowledge-holders of land use history and local conditions [@ianniRevitalizingTraditionalEcological2015],
(2) managers of semi-natural habitats [@mcginlayThreatAbandonmentSocioecological2017], and
(3) key hubs of social-ecological networks, who build community-based experience favouring the resilience of local farming systems [@barracloughMappingStakeholderNetworks2022; @marenDiversifiedFarmingSystems2022; @shiSocialInteractionEffect2021].
To support knowledge-building capacities amongst small-scale farming communities, along with large-scale dissemination of research outcomes, we recommend using already leading global collaboration networks, such as the World Network of UNESCO Biosphere Reserve [@barracloughMappingStakeholderNetworks2022; @barracloughGlobalKnowledgeAction2023; @bohnetCocreatingCulturalNarratives2025].

# CONCLUSION

Our study shows how environmental gradients operating at different spatial scales can influence plant and animal communities of semi-natural grasslands in the fjord region of Western Norway.
We found that both dominant grass and forb assemblages were primarily determined by the fine-scale environment, while dominant dung-associated beetle assemblages were consistently correlated with the composition of the landscape matrix.
There was no evidence of an effect of field management on dominant assemblages, even though our findings suggest the existence of an indirect link mediated by field productivity.
Therefore, our analyses indicate that, in small-scale grazing systems, the effect of different grazing managements may be overridden by stronger influences of environmental gradients.
Overall, we highlighted the complexity of interactions between the farmer, the environment and the livestock in small-scale grazing systems.
A more nuanced unraveling of this complexity could be achieved through explicitly addressing the spatiotemporal variability of rotational management, developing transdisciplinary approaches with farmers, and integrating the outcomes of local studies as part of large-scale knowledge-sharing networks, such as the UNESCO World Network of Biosphere Reserves.
