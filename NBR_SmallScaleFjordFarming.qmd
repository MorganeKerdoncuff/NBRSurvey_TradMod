# ABSTRACT

We aimed to present an exploratory study of the ecological interactions between grassland communities of dominant grasses, forbs and beetles, and sets of environmental factors which characterize low-intensity farming in Norwegian fjord across scales. We used canonical correlation analysis to determine linear correlations between sets of explanatory and community variables.


# INTRODUCTION

## Sustainable food production through traditional grazing systems

When facing the upcoming challenge regarding global food security (@kastnerGlobalChangesDiets2012; @vandijkMetaanalysisProjectedGlobal2021), the temptation to dive into the multiplication of crops has already received some warnings (@foleySolutionsCultivatedPlanet2011, @hunterAgriculture2050Recalibrating2017). Not only the current issue revolves more around optimizing food availability by reducing waste and changing diets rather than increasing food production (@cassidyRedefiningAgriculturalYields2013; @kastnerGlobalChangesDiets2012; @westLeveragePointsImproving2014), but conventional cropping systems have now reached limitations which are particularly visible in European countries: keeping on the intensification track would sacrifice the agro-ecosystems of high conservation values (@haladaWhichHabitatsEuropean2011; @jongmanHomogenisationFragmentationEuropean2002) without providing such a substantial increase in productivity (@garibaldiFarmingApproachesGreater2017; @jeanneretIncreaseFoodProduction2021).

- Conventional systems are often justified to be more productive, yet the trade-off between farm profitability and crop yield has yet to be established (@garibaldiFarmingApproachesGreater2017)
- The food productivity does not seem related to share of semi-natural habitats in Europe, including Norway (@jeanneretIncreaseFoodProduction2021). Meaning that a full transition into crop systems, if ever possible, would sacrifice biodiversity of the agricultural landscape for only a limited gain of production.
- *[Trends semi-natural habitats]*
- Area cover of meadows and pastures have been globally decreasing for the past decades, but this decrease has been particularly sharp in Europe, which lost 56% of its grazing lands between 1961 and 2020 (@FAODATA)
- European agricultural landscape has already suffered loss of biological and cultural diversity through habitat fragmentation and homogenization (@jongmanHomogenisationFragmentationEuropean2002)
- The primary function of agriculture (food production) of European cultural landscapes has declined in favour of other roles to match demands for recreation and nature conservation (@vosTrendsEuropeanCultural1999)
- Northern meadows and Fennoscandian pastures fully dependent on agricultural management
(@haladaWhichHabitatsEuropean2011)
- All remaining high nature conservation value grasslands in Europe associated with low-intensity livestock systems (@bignalLowIntensityFarmingSystems1996)
- Traditional farming systems adapted to local environment instead of more recent trends (@bignalLowIntensityFarmingSystems1996; @jongmanHomogenisationFragmentationEuropean2002)
Principles of traditional systems (@plieningerTraditionalLanduseNature2006):
  -	Multiple use: risk minimisation through polyculture & interaction between public, common & private land-use
  -	Rotational use: spatial & temporal differentiation
  -	Recycling between outputs & inputs
  -	Low-energy economy: scarcity of energy & transport resources
  -	Spatial fuzziness: different land-use structures & processes intertwined


## Intertwined drivers within small-scale farming systems in a fjord landscape (concept)

- The productivity potential of individual grazing fields in small-scale farming is dependent from both natural and anthropogenic factors, which can be so deeply intertwined that it is difficult and maybe not always pertinent to treat them independently [REF].
- Topographical characteristics and soil quality have been shown to be drivers of plant community composition in managed grasslands, but overall variation explained for species composition quite low, especially compared to species diversity (@klimekPlantSpeciesRichness2007a)

## Response variables

- Even small conventional intensification steps, such as low artificial fertilizer use, can negatively affect species richness without systematically increase yield (@beckmannConventionalLandUse2019). Though this is context-dependent, we can consider that within our survey area we do have a gradient of intensity (@tbl-farmermanagement)


## Aim & hypotheses

- Many studies focus on species richness, or highlight rare species. Though for the viability of the farm the dominant community drives the main service (fodder)
- Grazing management will be one of the main drivers despite the high environmental constraints

# MATERIAL AND METHODS

## Study area

The UNESCO Nordhordland Biosphere Reserve (NBR) is located in Western Norway. Its main geomorphological feature is the fjord landscape, the deepest arm reaching \[**NB**\] km inland. The climate is oceanic, characterized by mild temperature (**mean January, mean June**) and high precipitation level (**VALUE**). There are both temperature and precipitation west-east gradients [@kalandNordhordlandBiopshereReserve2018]. The coastal region buffers the climate seasonal cycle while temperature annual variation increases inland. The precipitation gradient is greatly affected by the topography: the mean annual precipitation is twice as much in higher elevation compared to the flat coastal areas.

## Study sites

We sampled 29 grassland fields across the Southern part of the NBR (@fig-sitemap).

```

Sites were either grazed by sheep, goats or cows for at least the past 5 years, and have been under grazing management for the past decade. Grasslands were chosen to be representative of small-scale farming system in Western Norway, with low-intensity grazing and limited amount of inputs. To the knowledge of the current farmers, no field was resown and/or plowed since the 1970s. Four sites were drained between 1990 and 2010 (OS1, IC1, OS4, OC3). The different treatments applied to the fields (grazing excluded) are described in Appendix (@tbl-farmermanagement).

+ PHYTOSOCIOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION GRASSLANDS?

## Conceptual framework

*For Amy and Inger: I gathered everything related to the study concept here for now, but maybe some of this should be moved to the Introduction at some point*

The potential drivers of the plant and beetle community were divided into 4 categories regarding their scale of influence and their relationship with human activity. We first present a summary (@fig-fjordconcept) before describing each set of variables with more details:

-   the **fjord system** encompasses all geomorphological features which define the landscape and are independent of any human influence.
-   the **landscape matrix** gathers the different land covers and uses which surround the field within 1 km2 radius. It is both dependent of the topography and the human activity (forestry, crops, grazing, infrastructures...).
-   the **grazing management** relates to the livestock breeding and to the structure of infield area of the farm. It is likely to be influenced by the landscape topography and the types of available habitats around the farm.
-   the **fine-scale environment** at the sampling area level represents all the ecological parameters which can directly or indirectly influence the local niches. These drivers will be affected by all factors occurring at wider scale.

## Data collection

*For Amy and Inger: a sketch of the sampling design will obviously come*

### Sampling set-up

Ecological data were collected between June and July 2019 and 2020. A sampling area of 20 x 20 m^2^ which was representative of the grazing field was defined on each site. Field edges, wet zones and exposed rocks were avoided. Three plots of 3 x 3 m^2^ were set within the sampling area, with a distance of at least 6 m between each other. The plots were divided into 9 quadrats of 1 m^2^ which were split into two groups, one for non-destructive measurements (5 quadrats) and one for destructive measurements (4 quadrats). All samples from one site except beetles were collected the same day.

### Plant community data

Plant species and percent cover were collected on non-destructive quadrats, for a total of 15 quadrats per site. The identifications were made by the two same observers for both years. The percent cover of the different functional groups and the vegetation mean height were also collected on the same quadrat.

### Beetle community data

Beetle specimens were collected with dung-baited pitfall traps located on the destructive quadrats, for a total of 12 pitfall traps per site. The traps were made of white plastic cups of 750 mL (**DIAMETER**) filled to 1/4 with salted water and a drop of neutral detergent to break water surface tension [REF]. The traps were set into the ground with the edge at the same level as the soil surface and covered with a metal grid with a [**MESH SIZE**] of cm^2^. A ball of fresh cow dung was then placed on the middle of the grid roof in a way that it would leave a substantial empty space around the edge of the cups for the beetles to fall in. The traps were left on site for one full week before being retrieved.

Beetles were stored in 70% ethanol and sorted into families in the lab using @duffBeetlesBritainIreland2012b.

### Soil compaction data

All data collection related to soil physical properties was done in destructive quadrats.

For the measure of the penetration rate we used a sharp [**MATERIAL?**] stick which would be dropped into the ground from a 1 m height. The drop was made through a plastic tube to ensure the stick direction. The visible standing part of the stick was measured and substracted from the total stick length to obtain the length of penetration into the soil. We performed two penetration tests per quadrat, one on each upper corner (**FIG**), for a total of 24 tests per site. The tip was regularly sharpened and its length remeasured across the field season.

We sampled three soil cores of [**MEASURES**] in each quadrat for the measure of the bulk density and the soil moisture. Cores were made of PVC tubes which edges have been sharpened. Prior to sinking the cores into the soil with a light hammer, the surrounding root mat was cut with a knife to limit soil disturbance during the sampling. Cores were covered with plastic foil and stored at 6.C before processing in the lab. [**QUICK DEFINITION OF BD**] The actual soil volume of each core was checked and corrected if necessary prior to weight measurements. We weighted the cores before and after drying in oven at 105.C, and calculated the bulk density and the percent soil moisture as following:
$$
\text{Bulk density }(g/cm^3) = \frac{\text{Core dry weight (g)}}{\text{Core volume }(cm^3)}
$$.

$$
\text{Soil moisture (%)} = \frac{\text{Core dry weight (g)}}{\text{Core fresh weight (g)}}
$$.

Bulk density and soil moisture data needed some adjustments due to field and lab constraints. When field sampling was poorly performed because of high roots density, high sand rate or steep slope, the core volume actually filled with soil could be very low. Bulk density estimation being less accurate on low soil volumes, we discarded cores with an estimated volume of soil under 350 cm^3^. A scale dysfunction issues also affected some of our samples during soil weighing. Negative or extreme values were removed. After data filtering, all sites had between 15 and 36 sample replicates.

### Soil chemistry data

We collected a supplementary soil core in each destructive quadrat for chemical analyses, for a total of 12 cores per site. We used a [**MATERIAL**] core of [**VALUE**] cm diameter and 12 cm depth which was dug into the ground by rotational movements. The soil was stored at 4.C before lab processing. Cores were sieved and merged at the plot level, and 0.5 L was sent to Eurofins for nitrogen and phosphorus quantitative analyses. Total nitrogen content and available phosphorus were determined by using modified Kjeldahl method (NS-EN 13654-1:2890) and ammonium lactate extraction method [REF âRapport 6/92â by T. Kroghstad] respectively. 

### Topographical data

We recorded field slope angle on site with a clinometer, with the observer standing at the highest point and looking down to another observer standing at the lowest point. The mean elevation and the sites coordinates were also collected on the field with a GPS. The aspect degree of the site was determined from geospatial data. An aspect map in degree azimuth of the whole NBR was generated in QGIS (version 3.12.2) from a Digital Elevation Model collected on GeoNorge [**LINK**]. The distance between sites and closest sea bodies was geospatially measured on the map Norge i bilder [**LINK**].

*! NEED CELL SIZE FOR DIGITAL ELEVATION MODEL*

### Landscape data

We collected land cover data on the natural information map Norgeskart [**LINK**] provided by the Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy (NiBIO). Surfaces of land covers including forests, agricultural lands, water bodies and human infrastructures, were retrieved for a buffer zone of 1 km^2^ radius around each field. We simplified the area classification to limit our number of variables: we combined non-managed and managed forests, as well as fully and partially cultivated lands.

### Field management data

Information on the grazing management of each field were collected from the farmers with phone interviews conducted from October 2021 to January 2022 [**SURVEY APPENDIX**]. Three farmers could not or did not want to reply to our survey. We completed the missing values with data from a similar interview series conducted in 2018 [**REF TO MARGIT MASTER THESIS**].

We asked the farmers for the following elements:

- The type of livestock (cow, sheep or goat) which has been grazing the site for at least the past 5 years. There was no mixed-grazing in the fields we selected.
- The size of the flock, including adults and young.
- The number of months the animals stayed on the field
- The total size of the infields
- The size of the field we sampled

Other information related to the farm management are available in Supplementary Information (@tbl-farmermanagement).

The standard calculation of stocking density is made with the following formula [REF]:
$$
\text{Stocking density} = \frac{\text{number of animals}\times{\text{standard livestock unit}}}{\text{surface}\times{\text{grazing period}}}
$$

*Chunk under work*
Two difficulties here.
Due to rotational grazing management, the period of grazing is not that accurate throughout the years.
Also the flock can also be separated by the farmer and spread into different fields.
Due to missing replies from farmers and the absence of equivalent data in the previous study, we did not have the period of grazing for all sites.
We therefore decided to estimate an average grazing intensity across all grazing fields for each farm.
The formula is as following:
Average grazing intensity on infields = (number of adults * standard livestock unit + number of young * standard livestock unit)/(total grazing area of the farm)
This total grazing area was retrieved from GÃ¥rdskart.no, which maps agricultural properties across Norway (NIBIO).
We considered infields but also surrounding unclassified areas which were known from the farmer and/or the field to be grazed.
In two sites, the goats were sent in the summer farms in the mountains for several months in the year.
This was recurring and well described by the farmer.
For these two sites only we therefore decided to keep the first formula.

## Data analysis

*Section under work*

### Data standardisation

All data were summarized at the site level. Beetle abundances of all pitfall traps were summed up. For all the other variables (plant community, soil), the site value was calculated as the average of the sample values.

### Variable colinearity

We checked for variables with a correlation coefficient over 0.7.
When it was possible, we kept the variable with the highest rate of replication within the site.
If the number of replicates was similar, then we chose according to ecological significance.
For soil data, bulk density was strongly correlated with moisture (0.86), LOI (0.8), Humus (0.8) and nitrogen (0.82).

### Linear relationships between variables

We plotted DCA and PCA residuals respectively for plant species and beetle families against each variable.
A straight line close to the x-axis means a linear relationship.
The linearity of the relationship was tested by the Tukey test.

### Descriptive statistics?

*Should I make a table with mean, sd, min & max of each variables?*

## Interpretation canonical correlations

- strong correlation between the fjord topography and the landscape, but the two sets did not show any correlation with lower scales
- strong correlation between the grazing management and the dominant grass community, but not significant for the forbs or the beetles
- one weakly supported correlation (p<0.1) between grazing management and the fine-scale environment of the beetle assemblage
- strong correlation between the fine-scale environment and the dominant grass community, weaker but still significant for the dominant forb community, not significant for the beetle assemblage
- no set of drivers shows any significant correlation with the beetle assemblage

```

The total infield surface of the farm drives the first axis (@fig-grazingxgrass12), while the livestock types are opposing themselves (sheep in upper left, cow in lower left). *Lolium perenne* would be associated with farms with a high grazing surface. *Poa trivialis* and *Deschampsia cespitosa* would be associated with cow sites (@fig-grazingxgrass23).

```{r VR_locenvixgrass}
#| label: fig-locenvixgrass
#| out-width: "800px"
#| fig-cap: "Visual representation of the canonical correlation between the fine-scale environment and the main grass species community"
#| message: true
#| warning: true
knitr::include_graphics("outputs/pval_significant/cancor_locenvixgrass.png")
```

The first axis is driven by the penetration rate on the right and by the pH on the left (@fig-locenvixgrass). *Deschampsia flexuosa* seems associated with soft soils. The second axis is driven by the mean phosphorus rate. *Lolium perenne* seems associated with rich soils.

### Main forb species

```{r VR_locenvixforb}
#| label: fig-locenvixforb
#| out-width: "800px"
#| fig-cap: "Visual representation of the canonical correlation between the fine-scale environment and the main forb species community"
#| message: true
#| warning: true
knitr::include_graphics("outputs/pval_significant/cancor_locenvixforb.png")
```

The first axis is also driven by the penetration rate on the right and by the pH on the left (@fig-locenvixforb). *Trifolium repens* seems associated with basic soil. The mean phosphorus rate is isolated from all the other drivers and all the species on the upper-right corner. Forb species would not be favored by very rich environment.

## Main beetle families

```{r VR_locenvixbeetle}
#| label: fig-locenvixbeetle
#| out-width: "800px"
#| fig-cap: "Visual representation of the canonical correlation between the fine-scale environment and the main beetle families community"
#| message: true
#| warning: true
knitr::include_graphics("outputs/pval_significant/cancor_locenvixbeetle.png")
```

First axis significant driven by the penetration rate (@fig-locenvixbeetle). Curculionidae and Elateridae are located at the other side of the axis.

### Influence of fjord system

#| message: true
#| warning: true
knitr::include_graphics("outputs/pval_significant/cancor_fjordxlandscape_beetle_dim13.png")
```

The aspect and the distance to sea are driving the first dimension, the slope drives the second dimension and the elevation drives the third dimension. The forest cover would increase inland, with increasing elevation (@fig-fjordxlandscape12, @fig-fjordxlandscape13). On areas with steep slopes, the most important land use around the field would be infields and cultivated lands.

# DISCUSSION

## No correlation between broad-scale variables and community compositions

- For the landscape: as we focused on main species for the plant communities and on main families for the beetle assemblages, We probably lack resolution to be able to detect any effect. If present, forest or wetland specialists would not weight much in the pools and probably be part of the rare species -> low level of replication, low resolution
- influence of broad-scale variables smaller if not invisible at small extent and grain (@siefertScaleDependenceVegetationenvironment2012)
- strong effect of slope on meadows composition compared to pastures, where elevational gradient is substantially smaller (@klimekPlantSpeciesRichness2007a)

## Fine-scale effect

- Edaphic parameters main drivers of plant species composition (@siefertScaleDependenceVegetationenvironment2012), especially pH (@zelnikPlantSpeciesDiversity2013).
- Nitrogen fertilization: grasslands with *Stellaria media*, *Poa annua* & *Poa trivialis* positively correlated, while *Ranunculus acris*, *Trifolium pratense* and *Rumex acetosa* negatively correlated (@klimekPlantSpeciesRichness2007a)
