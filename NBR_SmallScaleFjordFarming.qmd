# ABSTRACT

We present an exploratory study of the cross-scale influence of environmental factors characterising small-scale farming systems in Norwegian fjord over dominant grass, forb and beetle assemblages. We used canonical correlation analysis to determine linear correlations between sets of explanatory and community variables.

# INTRODUCTION

<!-- The literature pool assessing the global impact of intensive farming on nature including habitat loss and fragmentation [@jongmanHomogenisationFragmentationEuropean2002], soil erosion and depletion [**REF**], freshwater pollution through nutrient leaching [REF], and biodiversity loss [@beckmannConventionalLandUse2019; @newboldGlobalEffectsLand2015; @kleijnRelationshipFarmlandBiodiversity2009] with subsequent erosion of ecosystem functions and services [@jeanneretIncreaseFoodProduction2021; @flynnLossFunctionalDiversity2009], has been growing relentlessly for the past 20 years and has made fertile ground for alarming predictions if business-as-usual was to continue over the rest of the century [@hunterAgriculture2050Recalibrating2017; @foleySolutionsCultivatedPlanet2011; @egliWinnersLosersNational2018]. -->

<!-- At the European scale, even though the Green Revolution did substantially increase food security over the second half of the XX^th^ century, the current degraded state of agricultural lands is rather forecasting stagnation if not decline of productivity potential for the coming decades [@jongmanHomogenisationFragmentationEuropean2002; @haladaWhichHabitatsEuropean2011; @vosTrendsEuropeanCultural1999]. Less emphasized is the impact of the agro-industrial model and trade on the people standing at the frontline of the chain, namely the farmers. While they should be amongst the most influential apparatus regarding land use and natural resource management, they find themselves at the bottom of the decision-making process, subdued to the versatility of the market and competing with fellow farmers from the other side of the globe [@holt-gimenezAgroecologyFoodSovereignty2012]. -->

<!-- First biosphere reserve in Norway, the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve (NBR) captures the singularity and variety of small-scale grazing systems in Western Norway [@kalandNordhordlandBiosphereReserve2018]. To adapt to the complex topographic and climatic gradients driven by the fjord geomorphology [@ketzlerClimateNorway2021], former farmer-fishermen communities relied on small, self-sustained farms, encompassing most of necessary resources and land use types for subsistence of the household [@hetlandPluriactivityStrategyEmployment1986]. Thus, typical farm units would encompass a few arable lands, some forested areas, more productive infields for hay-making and less productive outfields for livestock grazing, resulting in a both temporally and spatially dynamic mosaic-like landscape [@haugeGaldaneLaerdalWestern1988; @hjelleHesitantHuntersReview2006; @indrelidFarmingSystemIts1988; @olssonAgroecosystemsNeolithicTime1991]. Following the global productivist strategy promoted in the 1970s, the intensification of agricultural practices coupled with the socio-economic decline of rural areas initiated two antagonist trends, still ongoing nowadays [@bjorkhaugMultifunctionalAgriculturePolicy2008]. On one hand, infields have been enlarged and improved with the introduction of artificial fertiliser to support the shift towards market-oriented livestock production, while more remote outfields have been progressively abandoned, leading to a drastic decline of the number of holdings [@fjellstadPatternsChangeTwo1999; @forbordDriversChangeNorwegian2014; @hamreLandcoverStructuralChanges2007a; @jonesLandtenureLandscapeChange1988]. However, compared to the rest of Norway and other European countries, in Nordhordland agricultural intensification has remained limited due the environmental constraints, thus preserving at least to a better extent small-scale grazing practices and the highly valued fjord landscape [@dramstadTenancyNorwegianAgriculture2010; @fjellstadPatternsChangeTwo1999]. -->

Industrialised agriculture reliant upon globalized food chains has pushed the capacity of the Earth system beyond its limits [@steffenPlanetaryBoundariesGuiding2015; @ipbesGlobalAssessmentReport2019; @richardsonEarthSixNine2023]. The literature pool assessing its global impact on biodiversity [@beckmannConventionalLandUse2019; @kleijnRelationshipFarmlandBiodiversity2009; @newboldGlobalEffectsLand2015], with subsequent erosion of ecosystem functions and services [@jeanneretIncreaseFoodProduction2021; @flynnLossFunctionalDiversity2009], has been growing relentlessly over the past 20 years and has made fertile ground for alarming predictions if business-as-usual was to continue over the rest of this century [@egliWinnersLosersNational2018; @foleySolutionsCultivatedPlanet2011; @hunterAgriculture2050Recalibrating2017; @salaGlobalBiodiversityScenarios2000]. Following the repeated calls for a sustainable transition of agriculture in order to transcend short-term productivist strategies, a regained interest has grown towards small-scale farming systems [@cunninghamCloseYieldgapSaving2013; @garibaldiFarmingApproachesGreater2017; @kremenDiversifiedFarmingSystems2012; @torokGrazingEuropeanOpen2016]. By prioritising long term preservation of natural resources over short-term yield maximisation, these approaches enhance the heterogeneity and resilience of agro-ecosystems [@gardnerAgriculturalResiliencePerspectives2019; @menconiRevisitingGlobalFood2022], thus empowering local communities and supporting biodiversity of high value [@altieriLinkingEcologistsTraditional2004; @bignalLowintensityFarmingSystems1996a; @sonninoLocalFoodscapesPlace2013]. By nature adaptative and tailored to the local environment, small-scale farming is not suited for standardisation and therefore requires an extensive effort of research across ecosystems to comprehend the whole spectrum of practices and how they interact with environmental dynamics and feedback [@altieriLinkingEcologistsTraditional2004; @cunninghamCloseYieldgapSaving2013; @gomesHeuristicsFarmHeterogeneity2022; @joseEcologicalConsiderationsSustainable2019]. A well-suited framework for this task is the UNESCO World Network of Biosphere Reserves (WNBR), which, through the Man and Biosphere (MAB) program, offers a platform for international collaboration and knowledge-sharing [@unescoNewRoadmapMan2017]. As model areas for regional experimentation and implementation of sustainable development [@barracloughGlobalKnowledgeAction2023; @unitednationsTransformingOurWorld2015], Biosphere Reserves promote applied research directed towards food security and locally adapted agricultural production [@anderzenEffectsOnfarmDiversification2020; @kratzerRuralInnovationsBiosphere2019; @tamouPastoralistsChangingEnvironment2018].

In Norway, the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve (NBR) showcases in a nutshell the diversity and singularity of small-scale grazing systems in westerly fjords [@kalandNordhordlandBiosphereReserve2018]. Strong climatic and topographic gradients first constrained farmer-fishermen communities to develop pluriactivity in small, self-sustained farms [@haugeGaldaneLaerdalWestern1988; @hetlandPluriactivityStrategyEmployment1986; @hjelleHesitantHuntersReview2006a; @mehlCulturalLandscapeDevelopment2015a], before limiting agriculture intensification during the post-WW2 productivist era [@dramstadTenancyNorwegianAgriculture2010; @fjellstadPatternsChangeTwo1999]. The resulting agro-ecological landscape encompasses amongst other grazed grasslands, arable lands, hay-meadows and forested areas in a fine-grained mosaic holding both high ecological and cultural values [@cusensParticipatoryMappingReveals2022; @wehnAdaptiveBiodiversityManagement2018]. Small-scale grazing in semi-natural grasslands involves rotational management with low stocking density and high diversity of locally-adapted breeds of cattle, sheep and goats. These different practices, documented in both grazing experiments and observational studies, have shown not only to enhance biodiversity [@bakkerDoesResourceAvailability2003; @skornikEffectGrazingPressure2010; @wangDiversifyingLivestockPromotes2019], but also to increase field productivity [@boavistaEffectsGrazingRegimes2019; @skornikEffectGrazingPressure2010].

There is however a limit when assessing effect of grazing management independently from environmental context [@duelliBiodiversityEvaluationAgricultural1997] as species distribution in a given habitat results from intricate organism-environment interactions across different spatial and temporal scales [@freestoneRegionalEnrichmentLocal2006; @joseEcologicalConsiderationsSustainable2019; @oesterheldImpactGrazingSpecies2011]. For instance, as climatic gradients shape regional species pools [@blonderLinkingEnvironmentalFiltering2015; @habelEuropeanGrasslandEcosystems2013] and habitat productivity [@gaoChangesGlobalGrassland2016; @guoSpatialVariationsAboveground2012], factors such as geographical location [@birkhoferGeneralRelationshipsAbiotic2012], elevation [@austrheimPlantDiversityPatterns2002; @turtureanuScaleTaxondependentBiodiversity2014], temperature and precipitation [@dauberLocalVsLandscape2005; @wehnAdaptiveBiodiversityManagement2018; @zelnikPlantSpeciesDiversity2013] are likely to influence species distribution not only across the NBR, but also at finer scale through site specific conditions [@fynnManagingBrowsingGrazing2019; @reitaluDeterminantsFinescalePlant2014]. Likewise, surrounding landscape composition [@steffan-dewenterScaledependentEffectsLandscape2002; @leprovostContrastingResponsesBelowground2021; @soderstromPlantsInsectsBirds2001; @zulkaSpeciesRichnessDry2014] and structure [@billeterIndicatorsBiodiversityAgricultural2007; @concepcionEffectsLandscapeComplexity2008; @gonthierBiodiversityConservationAgriculture2014; @hassLandscapeConfigurationalHeterogeneity2018] not only affect the flow of grassland species but can also enrich the assemblage with specialists from other habitats. Lastly, in-field environmental conditions, either completely inherent (e.g. topography) [@klimekPlantSpeciesRichness2007; @turtureanuScaleTaxondependentBiodiversity2014] or affected by broader climatic gradients and grazing disturbance for instance (e.g. soil properties) [@dorroughPlantNeighbourhoodLandscape2007; @mayelHowDoesGrassland2021; @zelnikPlantSpeciesDiversity2013], are likely to shape stress levels and resource availability to organisms.

Thus, considering that small-scale agro-ecological systems are embedded within complex contexts of cross-scale influence and feedback between organisms, environmental gradients and human management, to what extent can Nordhordland farmers truly affect their grazing fields [@hustonLocalProcessesRegional1999; @siefertScaleDependenceVegetationenvironment2012]? When it comes to grazing systems, most studies have taken a conservation perspective within contexts of either exceptionally high biodiversity [@denglerBiodiversityPalaearcticGrasslands2014; @habelEuropeanGrasslandEcosystems2013; @turtureanuScaleTaxondependentBiodiversity2014] or agricultural intensification [@billeterIndicatorsBiodiversityAgricultural2007; @gonthierBiodiversityConservationAgriculture2014; @zulkaSpeciesRichnessDry2014], thus rather focusing on diversity and/or rarity indicators. The variation of ordinary plant and animal communities have been less thoroughly investigated [but see @kleinebeckerEffectsGrazingSeasonal2011; @klimekPlantSpeciesRichness2007; @zelnikPlantSpeciesDiversity2013] even though it offers both fundamental and applied prospects not only for habitat conservation [@jiguetInferencesCommonSpecies2006] but also towards the ecosystem function and service frameworks [@avolioChangesPlantCommunity2014; @phoenixSustainingEcosystemServices2008]. Indeed, from the farmer's point of view the most important features of grazing fields are the quality and quantity of fodder, which largely depends on plant assemblage [@collombCorrelationFattyAcids2002; @frenchSpeciesCompositionDetermines2017a; @marrsReleaseSheepGrazing2020] and available resources such as soil nutrients, water or light availability [@augustineFeedbacksSoilNutrients2003; @avolioChangesPlantCommunity2014; @bakkerDoesResourceAvailability2003; @fayGrasslandProductivityLimited2015; @radujkovicSoilPropertiesKey2021]. Understanding what influences the fields functionality and productivity would undoubtedly benefit the preservation of small-scale grazing systems, which mainly relies on farmers' ability and willingness to pursue their activity [@mcginlayThreatAbandonmentSocioecological2017; @sinclairOptionsContextApproach2019; @stensekeBiodiversityLocalContext2006].

In this study we attempted to draw a preliminary picture of the different factors influencing dominant grass, forb and beetle assemblages of grazing fields in the NBR. These taxa were chosen according to their contributions to forage production, nitrogen capture and/or pollination, and nutrient recycling through dung decomposition respectively. We categorised environment and management variables into sets according to four spatial scales (@fig-fjordconcept): the **fjord system**, which encompasses climatic and landform features operating at the regional scale; the **landscape matrix**, which considers land uses around the farm; the **grazing management**, related to livestock breeding at the field and farm scales; and finally the **fine-scale environment** which includes edaphic, topographic and ground cover parameters at the level of the sampling area. Our main focus was to question whether grazing management would hold greater influence on plant and beetle assemblages compared with underlying environmental gradients, and if grazing management itself would be affected by them.

# MATERIAL AND METHODS

## Study area

The Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve (NBR) is located in the fjord system of Western Norway, enclosed between the Bergen region in the south and the Sognefjorden, the deepest Norwegian fjord, in the north [@kalandNordhordlandBiopshereReserve2018]. There are sharp elevation and climatic gradients from the flat coastal plateau on the west to the eastern mountains, with decreasing average July temperature, ranging from 15.9 to 8.3Â°C, and increasing annual precipitations, ranging from 1550 to 4800 mm [@ketzlerClimateNorway2021; @meteorologiskinstituttNorskKlimaservicesenter2023]. Our study area is located in the lowlands of the southern part of the NBR, under 250 masl.

In summer 2019 and 2020, we conducted an ecological survey on 29 grazing fields across the fjord system of the NBR (@fig-sitemap). Our sites were defined as "infields" (*innmarksbeite*), which are "*agricultural land that cannot be harvested mechanically* \[with\] *at least 50% of the area* \[...\] *covered with cultured grass or pasture-tolerant herbs*"according to the Norwegian "areal type" AR5 classification system [@ahlstromAR5Klassifikasjonssystem2019]. All fields were grazed for at least 10 years prior to sampling, with the same livestock type, either sheep, goats or cattle, for at least the last 5 years. According to the farmers, most fields had been continuously grazed for at least 50 years; only three had a short grazing interruption (5 years or under) and one had a long grazing interruption (20 years). Grazing intensity was low, with a maximum stocking rate of 0.6 yearly unit per ha. Twenty-one sites were fertilised at least occasionally with artificial fertiliser, manure and/or a mix of shell with sand or lime. To the knowledge of the farmers, no field had been resown and/or plowed since at least the 1970s, and only four out of the 29 sites received upgraded drainage between 1990 and 2010 (OS1, IC1, OS4, OC3). More details on the management and the different treatments applied to the fields are available in Supplementary Information (@tbl-farmermanagement).

## Data collection

We visited each of the 29 sites once between mid-June and late July, progressing from west to east according to respectively earlier and later spring bloom. On each site, we defined a nested sampling design within a representing 400 m^2^ area, preferentially as a 20 x 20 m^2^ square but when not possible (one site) as a 40 x 10 m^2^ area instead, avoiding rocks, waterlogged ground, trees and field edges. The same exclusion rules were applied when setting three plots of 3 x 3 m^2^ within the sampling area, at least 6 m apart from each other and 2 m away from the edge (@fig-sampling). Each plot was divided into nine quadrats of 1 m^2^, five of them dedicated to "non-destructive" plant community collection and the remaining four used for "destructive" soil and beetle sampling.

![Nested sampling design set on a representative area of each grazing field. The 400 m^2^ area was delimited by fences to prevent animals from entering. All data collections were done the same day except from beetles.](illustrations/NBR_SamplingDesign.png){#fig-sampling}

### Plant and beetle assemblages

All vascular plants were identified to the species level and attributed an average percent cover over each 1 m^2^ quadrat (15 quadrats per site). Identifications were made by the same two observers both years, using the Nordic flora [@mossbergGyldendalsStoreNordiske2018]. Species which could not be identified in the field were coded, collected, and identified *a posteriori* with the help of experts. In the same quadrat, we estimated the percent cover of bare ground, rock, litter, bryophytes and vascular plants. We also estimated sward height, defined as the average height of plant dominant assemblage, at three random locations within the quadrat.

We collected beetles with dung-baited pitfall traps set approx. 1 m from each other in each plot (12 traps per site). The traps were made of white plastic cups of 1 L (diam. 10.5 cm, height 11.5 cm) filled to 1/4 with salted water and a drop of neutral detergent to break water surface tension. We covered them with a square metal grid of 2 x 2 cm mesh size, on which we put a ball of about fist size of previously frozen cattle dung. The dung ball was placed at the centre of the grid, at least 3 cm from the edge of the cups to provide enough space for the beetles to fall in. The traps were left on site for one full week before retrieval. Beetles were sorted at the family level using @duffBeetlesBritainIreland2012a and stored in 70% ethanol. Spatial clumping of the pitfall traps, which compensated for short sampling time, should not have affected the beetle catches [@bakerEvaluatingSpatialAutocorrelation2006; @wardEffectsPitfallTrap2001].

### Soil data

We characterised soil structure with three complementary measurements: bulk density (BD) as a proxy for soil compaction, soil penetration resistance induced by root mat density and soil texture, and gravimetric water content (GWC) for water holding capacity. We measured soil penetration resistance by dropping a sharpened metal rod of 43.4 cm length (diam. 2.2 cm; weight \[**?**\]) from 1 m above ground through a PVC tube to ensure vertical fall. The visible standing part of the stick was measured and subtracted from the total stick length to obtain the length of penetration into the soil. Before dropping the stick, the surrounding vegetation around a 5 cm radius was cleared to prevent resistance from the aboveground vegetation. We performed two penetration tests per "destructive" quadrat, for a total of 24 tests per site. The tip was regularly sharpened and remeasured, and we observed a 1.6 % decrease in length (0.7 cm) by the end of the sampling season.

For BD and GWC measurements, we sampled three soil cores with PVC tubes of 57.23 cm^3^ (diam. 3.7 cm, height 10 cm) in each "destructive" quadrat (36 cores per site). To limit soil compression when hammering down the tubes, we sharpened the edges beforehand and used a knife to cut the surrounding root mat. Samples were covered with plastic foil and stored at 6Â°C before processing in the lab. If necessary, the soil volume of each core was corrected for holes or unfilled space prior to weighing. As actual soil volume could be low due to sampling constraints (high root density, shallow or sandy soil, steep slope), we discarded cores with less than 50 cm^3^ of soil to prevent inaccurate measurements of bulk density and soil moisture \[**ref**\], which represented approx. 20% of the total collected cores.

GWC is calculated as the difference in proportion between the soil fresh weight and the soil dry weight, and BD as the soil dry weight related to its volume:

$$
\text{Gravimetric water content } (\text{%}) = \frac{\text{Core moist weight } (g) - \text{Core dry weight } (g)}{\text{Core moist weight }(g)} *100
$$

$$
\text{Bulk density }(g/cm^3) = \frac{\text{Core dry weight }(g)}{\text{Core volume }(cm^3)}
$$ 

Usually, moist weight is measured from freshly sampled soil. However, as weather conditions varied considerably during our sampling, we standardised the measurement by weighing soil 48h after water saturation. Dry weight was obtained after 24h of drying in the oven at 105Â°C. After data filtering of low volumes and some negative values linked to a weighing balance dysfunction during lab processing, all sites had at least 9 measurements of BD and GWC.

For chemical analysis, we sampled soil with a stainless steel cylindrical core of 200 cm^3^ (diam. 10.5 cm; height 12 cm) in each "destructive" quadrat (12 cores per site). The soil was stored at 4Â°C before being sieved and pooled at the plot level. We sent 0.5 L of each pooled sample to a certified analysis laboratory to determine total nitrogen content with modified Kjeldahl method (NS-EN 13654-1:2890) [@bremnerDeterminationNitrogenSoil1960], and available phosphorus concentration with ammonium lactacte extraction method [@brayDeterminationTotalOrganic1945].

### Environmental data

We recorded field slope angle, elevation and field coordinates on site with a compass clinometer and a GPS (SCR EPSG:25832). We determined aspect degree from a Digital Elevation Model of 10 m x 10 m cell size retrieved from the GeoNorge online map catalog of the Norwegian Mapping Authority [@kartverketGeoNorgeKartkatalogen2023]. From the same resources, we also used a WMS Digital terrain model to measure distance to closest sea or fjord bodies. Average annual precipitation, July maximum temperatures and January minimum temperatures were calculated from 1 km^2^ daily projections provided by the Norwegian Centre for Climate Services over the period 2010-2020 [@wongGriddedKmClimate2016]. For sites not covered by the raster layer, values were determined from averaging values of neighbouring cells with the R software package *terra* (v. 1.7.29) [@hijmansTerraSpatialData2023; @rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2023].

For surrounding landscape composition, we calculated land use percent cover in a 1 km radius area around each field from land cover data provided by the Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research (NIBIO) [@norskinstituttforbiookonominibioKildenArealinformasjon]. Land cover was categorised according to the "areal type" AR5 classification system [@ahlstromAR5Klassifikasjonssystem2019], that we simplified into the following categories: forest area, including managed and non-managed; cultivated area, either fully or partially; infield area; outfield area; wetland area.

### Field management data

We conducted phone interviews with farmers from October 2021 to January 2022 to collect information on field management. For the 3 out of 26 farmers who were unable or unwilling to reply to our survey, we used data from a similar interview series conducted in 2018 [@reiersenBaerekraftVestnorskLandbruk2019]. Regarding grazing management, we asked the farmers for the following elements: the type of livestock which has been grazing the site for the past 5 years; the size of the flock, including adults and young; the number of months the animals stayed on the field; the total surface area of infields grazed by the animals on the farm; the size of the grazing infield we selected as a survey site (SI: @tbl-farmermanagement).

Standard calculation of stocking density is made with the following formula \[**REF**\]: 

$$
\text{Stocking density} = \frac{\text{number animals}\times{\text{standard livestock unit}}}{\text{area}\times{\text{grazing period}}}
$$ 

However, estimating stocking density for rotational grazing systems presented some challenges. Usually, farmers in Western Norway move their livestock across different fields year round, according to the productivity or state of the fields at any given point in time, without following a consistent schedule. Thus, as most respondents could not give us accurate grazing period for the infield we selected, we arranged the formula to calculate an average stocking density for the farms' total infield area over a year:

$$
\text{Average stocking density} = \frac{\text{Nadults}\times{\text{standard  LU}} + \text{Nyoung}\times{\text{young LU}} }{\text{total infield area of the farm}}
$$ 

As to our knowledge there is no standard livestock unit for young sheep and goats, we estimated it as half the value of adult (0.05 LU). Total infield area was retrieved from the map of agricultural properties made by the Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research (https://gardskart.nibio.no/). We gathered in this category areas classified as infields (*innmark*), but also unclassified areas which were known as grazing fields from the farmer and/or from field observation. For two farms (IG1 and IG2) which livestock was moved to mountain summer farms every year, we calculated average stocking density for the time period when animals were in the lowlands.

## Data analysis

Canonical correlation analysis searches for the maximum correlation between linear projections of two data sets [@hotellingRelationsTwoSets1992]. We performed four canonical correlation series to investigate 1. the cascading influence between explanatory sets of environmental and management variables, and 2. the influence of these different sets on dominant grass, forb and beetle assemblages. All statistical analyses were performed on R (v.4.3.2) with R-Studio (v.2023.12.1+402) [@positteamRStudioIntegratedDevelopment2023; @rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2023]. The canonical correlation analyses and the related statistical tests were made with the CCA [@gonzalezCCACanonicalCorrelation2021] and CCP [@menzelCCPSignificanceTests2022] packages. The redundancy analyses were performed with the vegan package [@oksanenVeganCommunityEcology2022]. The visual representations of RDA were made using the ggord package [@beckGgordOrdinationPlots2022]. All data from nested sampling design were averaged at the site level.

As canonical correlation analysis only accounts for quantitative variables, livestock type was transformed into dummy numeric. All explanatory variables were centered and scaled to address the high heterogeneity of units within most sets. We verified and filtered our explanatory variables first according to raw data distribution, removing variables with highly skewed distributions or with obvious outliers, and second by testing variable colinearity within each set with paired plots. When the correlation coefficient was equal to or over 0.8 between two variables, if applicable we kept the one with the highest within site replication and/or the most balanced distribution, otherwise the choice was made according to ecological relevance. The final list of variables kept for the canonical correlation analysis is shown in @fig-fjordconcept.

Community data were percent cover for grass (Poaceae) and forb species, and abundance for beetle families. We classified taxa according to their frequency and abundance across sites: species or families found in at least one-third of the infields, with a minimum average percent cover of 1% for the former and a minimum average occurrences of 3 for the latter, were selected for the analysis. In total, eight species of grasses, seven species of forbs and five families of beetles were selected (@fig-fjordconcept). Community data were transformed using Hellinger transformation, which lowers the weight of variables with low counts and many zeros [@borcardNumericalEcology2011; @legendreEcologicallyMeaningfulTransformations2001].

We tested for statistical significance of correlations with asymptotic approximation of Hotelling-Lawley Trace (*p.asym* function in CCP package) [@mullerPracticalMethodsComputing1984]. Significant canonical correlations were investigated further with Redundancy Analyses (RDA) [@legendreNumericalEcology2012]. We used adjusted R^2^ [@legendreTestingSignificanceCanonical2011; @peres-netoVariationPartitioningSpecies2006] and tested statistical significance of RDA models, axes and terms by ANOVA-like permutation (n = 999) [@legendreTestingSignificanceCanonical2011; @legendreNumericalEcology2012]. For illustrative purpose, we performed RDAs on all combinations of sets and provided them in Supplementary Information (@tbl-rdaenv; @tbl-rdagrass; @tbl-rdaforb; @tbl-rdabeetle).

## Cascading influence between explanatory sets

There was a strong canonical correlation between fjord features and landscape composition (first dimension correlation coefficient rho1 = `r envar$rho[1]`, F approximation of Hotelling-Lawley trace F~20,74~ = `r envar$approx[1]`, p-value = `r envar$p.value[1]`) (@fig-cancor A; @tbl-cancorenv), which was supported by the RDA model (proportion explained variance = `r rdastat_all$Variance[1]`, F~`r rdastat_all$Df[1]`~ = `r rdastat_all$F[1]`, p-value = `r rdastat_all$PrF[1]`) (@tbl-rdaexp). The most important factors were maximum July temperature (var = `r rdastat_all$Variance[4]`, F~1~ = `r rdastat_all$F[4]`, p-value = `r rdastat_all$PrF[4]`) and distance to sea (var = `r rdastat_all$Variance[5]`, F~1~ = `r rdastat_all$F[5]`, p-value = `r rdastat_all$PrF[5]`), driving axes 1 and 2 respectively (@fig-rda A). We observed more forested lands (score~RDA1~ = -0.71) but less outfields (score~RDA1~ = 0.75) in areas with higher summer temperature, while the proportion of wetlands increased with distance to sea (score~RDA2~ = 0.86). (*question for Adam - you pointed out the importance of highlighting clear relationships, could providing scores be enough of a justification, even if the axes themselves are not significant?*) On the other hand, the proportion of infields and cultivated lands did not seem affected by any variables from the fjord system set.

Canonical correlations in-between explanatory sets did not show any other significant relationships (@fig-cancor A; @tbl-cancorenv), but we nevertheless noticed a marginally significant RDA model between grazing and the fine-scale environment (var = `r rdastat_all$Variance[6]`, F~5~ = `r rdastat_all$F[6]`, p-value = `r rdastat_all$PrF[6]`), mostly driven by the presence of sheep (var = `r rdastat_all$Variance[9]`, F~1~ = `r rdastat_all$F[9]`, p-value = `r rdastat_all$PrF[9]`) and the area of the selected infield (var = `r rdastat_all$Variance[10]`, F~1~ = `r rdastat_all$F[10]`, p-value = `r rdastat_all$PrF[10]`) (@tbl-rdaexp).

Summary of RDA permutation tests for relationships which showed significant canonical correlations

## Cascading influence on dominant grass, forb and beetle assemblages

Only landscape composition did not show any significant canonical correlation with plant and beetle assemblages (@fig-cancor B-D; @tbl-cancorcom). Both dominant grass species and beetle families were at least marginally significantly correlated with the fjord system variable set (for grasses: rho1 = `r comvar$rho[1]`, F~28,66~ = `r comvar$approx[1]`, p-value = `r comvar$p.value[1]`; for beetles: rho1 = `r comvar$rho[11]`, F~20,74~ = `r comvar$approx[11]`, p-value = `r comvar$p.value[11]`) and the grazing management variable set (for grasses: rho1 = `r comvar$rho[3]`, F~35,77~ = `r comvar$approx[3]`, p-value = `r comvar$p.value[3]`; for beetles: rho1 = `r comvar$rho[13]`, F~25,87~ = `r comvar$approx[13]`, p-value = `r comvar$p.value[13]`), but none of these relationships were supported by corresponding RDA models (**SI**). Dominant grass and forb species were significantly correlated with fine-scale environment (for grasses: rho1 = `r comvar$rho[4]`, F~56,86~ = `r comvar$approx[4]`, p-value = `r comvar$p.value[4]`; for forbs: rho1 = `r comvar$rho[9]`, F~56,86~ = `r comvar$approx[9]`, p-value = `r comvar$p.value[9]`), and in these two cases RDA models were also significant (@tbl-rdacom).

The fine-scale environment x grass RDA model explained 48% of the variance (R~adj~^2^ = `r rdacom$adj.r.squared[1]`, F~8~ = `r rdacom$F[1]`, p-value = `r rdacom$PrF[1]`), with the two first axes accounting for 26% (F~1~ = `r rdacom$F[3]`, p-value = `r rdacom$PrF[3]`) and 10% (F~1~ = `r rdacom$F[4]`, p-value = `r rdacom$PrF[4]`) respectively (@tbl-rdacom). The first axis showed a vegetation gradient opposing taller sward on the left (var = `r rdacom$Variance[6]`, F~1~ = `r rdacom$F[6]`, p-value = `r rdacom$PrF[6]`), with associated species *Deschampsia cespitosa* and *Holcus lanatus*, to well-developed bryophyte layer on the right (var = `r rdacom$Variance[5]`, F~1~ = `r rdacom$F[5]`, p-value = `r rdacom$PrF[5]`), with associated species *Poa pratensis* (@fig-rda D). The second axis was driven by an edaphic gradient, characterised by decreasing pH (var = `r rdacom$Variance[7]`, F~1~ = `r rdacom$F[7]`, p-value = `r rdacom$PrF[7]`) along with soil resistance to penetration (var = `r rdacom$Variance[8]`, F~1~ = `r rdacom$F[8]`, p-value = `r rdacom$PrF[8]`), which favoured *Deschampsia flexuosa* over *Festuca rubra* and *Holcus lanatus* (@fig-rda C).

The RDA model between fine-scale environment and dominant forb assemblage explained 39% of the variance (R~adj~^2^ = `r rdacom$adj.r.squared[9]`, F~8~ = `r rdacom$F[9]`, p-value = `r rdacom$PrF[9]`) (@tbl-rdacom) and showed fairly similar gradients (@fig-rda D). The first axis, accounting for 18% of the variance (F~1~ = `r rdacom$F[11]`, p-value = `r rdacom$PrF[11]`), was mainly driven by soil resistance to penetration (var = `r rdacom$Variance[13]`, F~1~ = `r rdacom$F[13]`, p-value = `r rdacom$PrF[13]`) closely related, even though non-significantly, to soil pH (**SI**) and available phosphorus concentration (**SI**). *Potentilla erecta* and *Galium saxatile* were associated with poorer, more acidic soils with lower resistance, while *Ranunculus acris* and *Trifolium repens* were associated with more neutral soils with higher phosphorus concentration and resistance to penetration. The second axis was not significant (**SI**) but showed a clear gradient opposing tall swards (var = `r rdacom$Variance[12]`, F~1~ = `r rdacom$F[12]`, p-value = `r rdacom$PrF[12]`) to steep slope (**SI**) and well-developed bryophyte layer (**SI**).

# DISCUSSION

The cascading influence of environmental gradients across scales was only partially observed in our study. We found a well-supported correlation between the fjord gradient and the landscape composition, as well as a potential effect of grazing on the fine-scale environment, but we noted no influence of broader scales (fjord, landscape) over farm management and grazing fields. Regarding assemblage responses, there was a significant influence of fine-scale environment on dominant grass and forb species, mainly driven by sward height, soil resistance to penetration and bryophyte cover. However, we found no clear evidence that plant and beetle assemblages were affected by other environmental gradients as canonical correlations and redundancy analyses showed contradictory results.

## Fine-scale environment as the main factor of influence on dominant plant assemblages

Dominant grass and forb species were primarily affected by fine-scale environmental variation rather than variables associated with management, landscape and fjord geomorphology [@hejcmanRengenGrasslandExperiment2010; @myklestadSoilSiteManagement2004; @siefertScaleDependenceVegetationenvironment2012]. Both assemblages responded to two similar gradients, 1) sward height against bryophyte cover and 2) soil resistance to penetration against soil acidity, explaining the highest variation for grasses and forbs respectively. 

Sward height, which depends on individual species' growth form, can only be a poorly reliable predictor of species distribution when considered on its own, unless in strictly controlled experimental conditions [e.g. see @marriottLongtermImpactsExtensive2009 and @tonnGrazingInducedPatchiness2019]. For instance in our study, the tall and unpalatable *Deschampsia cespitosa*, where dominant, most probably contributed to higher average vegetation. However, when inversely related to bryophyte cover and, still consistently even if not significantly, to slope, it may be indicative of an underlying productivity gradient [@grimeCompetitiveExclusionHerbaceous1973; @hejcmanRengenGrasslandExperiment2007; @olffEffectsHerbivoresGrassland1998; @vanderwalMossesStruggleLight2005] with well-drained fields at one end and flatter, more productive fields at the other [@losvikHayMeadowCommunities1993]. Slope angle can indirectly affect both plant height [@dorroughPlantNeighbourhoodLandscape2007] and species composition [@klimekPlantSpeciesRichness2007] through for instance soil nutrient depletion [@kleinebeckerEffectsGrazingSeasonal2011] or average grazing time of animals [@fynnManagingBrowsingGrazing2019; @hesterForagingBehaviourSheep1999], but its effect is likely to be mediated by the slope aspect [@bennieInfluenceSlopeAspect2006; @dauberLandscapeStructureIndicator2003; @turtureanuScaleTaxondependentBiodiversity2014]. The combined influence of slope angle and aspect can be assessed through the heat load index (HLI), which approximates the amount of solar energy directly hitting the ground and thus available for plant growth [@merunkovaEnvironmentalControlSpecies2012; @turtureanuScaleTaxondependentBiodiversity2014]. Though this measure was initially considered in our analysis, we discarded it because of obvious outliers and instead included slope angle and aspect independently.

Soil resistance to penetration depends not only on soil properties including structure, texture, water content and carbon ratio, but also on biotic components such as plant roots [@forsterRootTraitsCrop2022; @mirrehInfluenceSoilBulk1972; @sojkaSituStrengthBulk2001]. Correlation with one or the other parameter is however far from being straightforward, as for example, soil resistance has been found to be either strongly [@gabrielCoverCropsReduce2021; @negronConsequencesIntensiveGrazing2019], weakly [@kumiQuantifyingRootinducedSoil2023] or conditionally [@sojkaSituStrengthBulk2001] associated with water content, depending on the considered soil layer. Likewise, average plant root diameter and seemingly root volume tend to increase soil resistance in experimental conditions, but the consistency of observations would be highly variable depending on soil texture and plant species [@kumiQuantifyingRootinducedSoil2023]. In our study, soil resistance to penetration was independent from bulk density, and by extent gravimetric water content and loss of ignition, but was systematically paired with a pH gradient. Lower resistance on more acidic soils could be explained by the increased concentration of ammonium [@brittoNH4ToxicityHigher2002; @kleijnSearchKeyBiogeochemical2008] and ionic aluminium [@halingRootMorphologyRoothair2010a; @kochianCellularMechanismsAluminum1995] which would inhibit plant root growth. However, experimental acidification in grasslands showed the opposite with an increase of root density following a community shift from forbs to perennial grasses [@chenBioticCommunityShifts2015; @wangSoilAcidificationAlters2020]. Unfortunately in the absence of direct assessment of root length and/or density, we cannot extrapolate further on whether plant root density was related to soil pH or accounted for most variation in soil penetration resistance compared with structural and textural soil properties.

<!-- - pH affects macro-nutrient availability [@mengGlobalSoilAcidification2019] -->
<!-- - strongest soil gradient in characterising plant phytosociological associations [@critchleyAssociationLowlandGrassland2002] -->
<!-- - main gradient combined with soil nutrient in driving plant species composition in nutrient-poor habitats [@rupprechtEffectsYearroundGrazing2016] -->
<!-- - variance of floristic composition second best explained by pH after elevation [@zelnikPlantSpeciesDiversity2013] -->
<!-- In managed grasslands, soil acidity mainly depends on bedrock type [@balstromStatisticallyBasedMapping2013; @fabianGEMASSpatialDistribution2014] and type, amount and/or frequency of fertilisation [@leechComparativeEffectAlternative2019; @vasakSoilPHChanges2015]. Bedrock type was not included in our analysis due to poor replication of the different categories in our set of sites, but *a posteriori* we did not observe clear trends in pH between soils from more acidic granitic gneiss (pH ranging from 4.3 to 5.0) and from more basic anorthosite (pH ranging from 4.9 to 5.1) [@norgesgeologiskeundersokelseNasjonalBerggrunnsdatabase2023]. -->

In contrast with results from both long-term experiments [@avolioChangesPlantCommunity2014; @hejcmanRengenGrasslandExperiment2010; @kiddImpacts120Years2017; @koernerNutrientAdditionsCause2016] and observational studies [@critchleyAssociationLowlandGrassland2002; @klimekPlantSpeciesRichness2007; @raatikainenImpactsLocalRegional2007; @rupprechtEffectsYearroundGrazing2016] we found no significant influence of soil available phosphorus and total nitrogen on dominant grass and forb assemblages.

- Either fertilisation only weakly affects the main type of fodder and pollen resources in comparison with the inherent characteristics of the NBR grazing fields [@losvikHayMeadowCommunities1993], or we failed to capture the complexity of plant species response to a broad spectrum of practices, ranging from no fertilisation to single or simultaneous use of artificial fertiliser, manure and/or shell-sand/lime mix.
- Plant growth is not only affected by macro-nutrients [@fayGrasslandProductivityLimited2015], their chemical forms [@ceulemansPhosphorusResourcePartitioning2017] or application modes (e.g. amount, frequency and timing) [*ref*], but also by their interaction with the existing soil nutrient pool [@bindrabanRevisitingFertilisersFertilisation2015], pH [@caiIntensifiedSoilAcidification2015; @kiddImpacts120Years2017; @mengGlobalSoilAcidification2019] and microbial community [@dincaFertilizationSoilMicrobial2022; @leechComparativeEffectAlternative2019].

- Total nitrogen and available phosphorus are widely used to indicate fertilisation regimes [@bindrabanRevisitingFertilisersFertilisation2015; @hejcmanRengenGrasslandExperiment2010; @myklestadSoilSiteManagement2004], but they both present methodological limitations: the former offers poor approximation of the concentrations of inorganic, available forms for plants (nitrate or ammonium) [@collinsSoilNitrateConcentrations2004; @stluceNitrogenDynamicsIndices2011], and their influences on plant communities are not reciprocal so one can not serve as indicator for the other.
- Thus individual species response to nitrogen and phosphorus can be challenging to detect [@lapierreDriversVariationAboveground2016] and show no coherence with plant strategies
- Species association showed no strong coherence with stress-tolerant *Festuca rubra* relatively closely associated with more competitive *Holcus lanatus* and *Poa pratensis* [@kiddImpacts120Years2017; @zarzyckiSchemeNutrientAddition2020].

- No significant individual species responses to experimental N & P addition regardless of grassland type, but when analysed in groups stronger absolute response of dominant grasses and stronger relative response of rare grasses & forbs to N or P depending on habitat productivity [@lapierreDriversVariationAboveground2016].

- Regarding soil pH for instance, mineral fertilisers such as inorganic nitrogen can dramatically acidify the soil [@kiddImpacts120Years2017], while animal manure and lime are usually used as neutralisers [@caiIntensifiedSoilAcidification2015; @hejcmanRengenGrasslandExperiment2010; @kalkhoranOptimalLimeRates2020; @xuModelbasedOptimalManagement2023].

- Available phosphorus was likely associated with the productivity gradient on the grass assemblage
- There is no competition over nutrients [@chapinNatureNutrientLimitation1986], maybe because of environmental pressures.
- Nutrient as limiting factors [@chapinNatureNutrientLimitation1986]

- There were clear methodological limitations regarding our measurements of edaphic parameters as we tended to favour coast and time efficiency over accuracy and reproducibility.
- As such, the measure of total nitrogen instead of the inorganic fraction available to plant has long been criticised

- We can point out clear methodological limitations regarding our measurements of edaphic parameters, as overall we favoured cost and time efficiency over accuracy and reproducibility.
- A proper assessment of bulk density requires the least perturbation of soil structure during sampling.
- In comparison with stainless steel cores, PVC tubes had thick and dull edges, making hard to dig them into the soil.
- The substantial discarding of samples (20%) due to low soil volume showcases the difficulties encountered.
- As there was strong correlation between BD and LOI, for such survey maybe more pertinent to only consider LOI.
- Soil resistance to penetration was not assessed with standard penetrometer [@sojkaSituStrengthBulk2001].
- pH was measured *ex situ*
- total nitrogen offer a poor approximation of available nitrogen for plants, which should be in inorganic form of nitrate (NO~3~^-^) or ammonium (NH~4~^+^) [@collinsSoilNitrateConcentrations2004; @stluceNitrogenDynamicsIndices2011]
- extraction available P @gilbertAvailableSoilPhosphorus2009
- the way farmers fertilise may not be homogeneous
- total content or average concentration may not be as representative to estimate nutrient limitation than spatial heterogeneity -> patch-like distribution of nutrients in the soil [@sittersImpactsBrowsingGrazing2019]
- + narrow time window which did not take in account farmer's time of fertilisation + seasonal variation of nutrient patchiness [@ryelTemporalDynamicsSoil1996]

## Grazing management

- We obtained inconsistent results between our canonical correlation and redundancy analyses on the effect of grazing management on the field's fine-scale environment and on dominant plant and beetle assemblages.
- We obtained inconsistent results between canonical correlation analyses, which showed at least marginally significant correlations between grazing management and dominant grass and beetle assemblages, and redundancy analyses, which only displayed marginally significant influence of grazing management and fine-scale environment.
- Not only particularly challenging to assess the effect of grazing management on grassland assemblages in observational studies, where factors such as intensity, periodicity and history are difficult to control, but even in controlled experiments such characteristics do not always show coherent results.
- Even the most studied parameter of intensity not that straightforward

- *Grazing intensity*
- experiment - grazing intensity in sheep grazing only significant on plant composition if heavy (12 against 4-7 sheep/ha) [@skornikEffectGrazingPressure2010]
- observation - community composition of semi-natural grasslands affected by cattle density (0.01-1.38 LSU/ha) [@buzhdyganDirectIndirectEffects2020]
- slow change in community composition under extensification which was yet to stabilise even after 16 years [@marriottLongtermImpactsExtensive2009]
- carabid & leaf-beetle community composition affected by grazing intensity (0.5-1.2 animal/ha), but not plants [@baldiEffectsGrazingBiogeographic2013]
- no effect of sheep & goat grazing intensity on Carabidae community in Mediterranean shrublands [@kaltsasGroundBeetlesRespond2013]
- extensive cattle grazing (2 ind/ha) favoured tall forbs while intensive grazing (4 ind/ha) favoured legumes [@ludvikovaLongTermDefoliation2014]
- cattle grazing intensity (5 cm vs 10 cm sward) affected plant species composition in upland meadow (420 masl) [@pavluEffectContinuousGrazing2006]
- sheep grazing intensity influenced plant species composition, but slower than when grazing abandonment in meta-analysis [@scohierHowSheepAffect2012]

- Livestock type
- contrary to butterflies & bumblebees, ground beetle abundance, species richness & species composition did not respond to livestock type (cattle vs sheep) or management type (continuous vs rotational) [@ravettoenriBiodiversityfriendlyRotationalGrazing2017]
- difference uptake strategies between ungulates, which focus on immediate nutritive intake, and ruminant, which favour higher daily digestible intakes [@wallisdevriesImportanceScalePatchiness1999] 
- overall low effect of cattle introduction (from single to mixed grazing) compared with intensity [@pakemanLongTermImpacts2019] 
- no effect of mixed-grazing (cattle & sheep) on plant composition in experiments [@jerrentrupDiverseSwardsMixedGrazing2020] 
- weak effect of livestock on species composition over time, with increase of forb contents and species richness under cattle grazing compared with sheep [@jerrentrupLittleGrazerSpecies2015]
- no effect of goat breed on vegetation cover or arthropod diversity & richness in heathland [@garciaEffectsLivestockBreed2009]

- Timing
- no clear effect of early (mid-June) vs late (mid-July) grazing on plant & arthropod biomass in mountainous grassland, apart for reduction of forb & Hemiptera biomass with late grazing [@davisEffectsTimingGrazing2014]
- effect of continuous vs late grazing reflected in functional attributes of Carabidae community (body size, life cycle, habitat preferences) in Nordic grassland [@lenoirEffectsTimingGrazing2010]

grazing x productivity 
- response of community composition to grazing treatments (grazing/no grazing) depends on site productivity: the most productive the site, the most change [@lezamaVariationGrazinginducedVegetation2014]
- response to grazing of only 5 out of 18 species was influenced by site productivity [@pakemanConsistencyPlantSpecies2004]

- Soil
- pasture type more important influence on soil structural properties than weight of cows [@negronConsequencesIntensiveGrazing2019]
- extensive cattle grazing (2 ind/ha) reduced soil compaction from 8 to 16 cm compared with intensive grazing (4 ind/ha), but not below & above in 12y experiment [@ludvikovaLongTermDefoliation2014]
- soil resistance to penetration, bulk density and pH increased under heavy and very heavy grazing compared with light grazing [@zhangSoilPhysicalChemical2019]
- no effect grazing/no-grazing on bulk density in cattle-grazed subhumid grasslands [@altesorEcosystemChangesAssociated2006]
- no effect of cattle grazing intensity on soil pH & organic carbon in costal meadow & dry grasslands [@dupreDifferencesSpeciesRichness2001]
- significant pH increase during 5y grazing cessation in Mediterranean mountainous grassland [@farrisShorttermEffectsSheep2010]

- Vegetation structure
- no significant effect stocking density on plant height, and trend rather non-intuitive as sward height increased with stocking density -\> but even our highest stocking density was relatively low
- vegetation stature declined with increasing intensity of sheep grazing [@dorroughPlantNeighbourhoodLandscape2007]
- vegetation height at the plot level lower under more intensive grazing [@pakemanLongTermImpacts2019]
- Cattle trampling strongly decreased bryophyte cover independently of grazing intensity & increased cover of graminoids [@ludvikovaLongTermDefoliation2014]

- Our methodological approach may be partially to blame for our ambiguous results, as shown by the poor fit of grazing management variables to the fine-scale environment gradient (@fig-rda B).
- The versatility of rotational management in the NBR small-scale grazing system makes it difficult to summarise and characterise into an appropriate set of variables.
- Usually, assessments of rotational grazing effect on biodiversity result from experiments with strict control over stocking density and length and timing of grazing period [@boavistaEffectsGrazingRegimes2019; @perottiYearRotationalGrazing2018; @ravettoenriBiodiversityfriendlyRotationalGrazing2017].
- If our calculation of stocking density probably lacked accuracy due to the averaging across total grazing field area, our main issue was the complete absence of temporality because of how circumstantial were the rotation schedules [@fetzelSeasonalityConstraintsLivestock2017].
- Considering how important are phenological implications when assessing assemblage responses to grazing [@davisEffectsTimingGrazing2014; @gilhausSeasonalVariationsFodder2016; @lennartssonEffectTimingGrassland2012], it is safe to assume that a substantial share of variation was missed by the use of "static" variables only.

- This shortcoming also question whether surveying a single grazing field would offer a meaningful picture of the real-life dynamic of rotational management in small-scale grazing systems.
- Scaling up the assessment to the farm level not only would help broaden our ecological understanding [@altieriLinkingEcologistsTraditional2004; @gonthierBiodiversityConservationAgriculture2014] but would also allow to couple/harmonise results with management policies and socio-ecological thinking [@kremenLandscapesThatWork2018; @wilsonWeakStrongMultifunctionality2008; @wittmanSocialEcologicalPerspective2017].

- Management history also very important 

-   potential effect grazing x fine-scale mostly on edaphic parameters
-   not really in line with grazing gradients, but bryophyte rather associated with sheep and height rather associated with stocking density (sheep against stocking density)
-   So no hints that low sward height associated with higher intensity grazing


- Beetles
- @martelImpactFarmingSystems2019
- @toccoPastoralPracticesReverse2013
- @lenoirEffectsTimingGrazing2010

- slow change in community composition under extensification which was yet to stabilise even after 16 years [@marriottLongtermImpactsExtensive2009]

-   response variables -\> only dominant species -\> responses to grazing depends on dominance level [@chanetonDisturbanceEffectsPlant1991]

-   did not look for feedback on grazing

-   *Functional resource heterogeneity*, which determines animals accessibility to fodder, is driven both by broader, spatially-fixed or temporally-recurrent factors, such as climate, topography and geology, and by finer, spatially and temporally variable factors, as for instance the patchiness of rainfall, grazing or fertiliser spraying by farmers [@fynnManagingBrowsingGrazing2019].

## How about beetles

@lichtenbergGlobalSynthesisEffects2017

- Coleoptera most sensitive arthropod group to cattle grazing intensity (1.4 ind/ha vs 5.5 ind/ha) in terms of diversity & abundance compared with Heteroptera & Auchenorrhyncha [@kruessContrastingResponsesPlant2002]
- no effect may be due to too coarse taxonomic level (family)
- carabid species composition responded to field management (crop vs mixed fodder/crop vs pastures) and heterogeneity at the farm level [@weibullSpeciesCompositionAgroecosystems2003]
- landscape intensification & homogenisation affected carabid communities towards smaller, more mobile and ubiquitous species [@burelDifferentialResponseSelected2004]
- carabid community in field relatively stable after 10 years [@purtaufCarabidCommunitiesSpatiotemporal2004]
- taxa (butterflies, carabids, plants) respond differently to landscape features and landscape more important driver for high mobility organisms [@weibullSpeciesCompositionAgroecosystems2003]
- Beetle & spiders can be affected by landscape -\> see @bataryResponsesGrasslandSpecialist2007, @bataryAreSpidersReacting2008, @ostmanLandscapeComplexityFarming2001
- Plant species richness significant driver of spiders, carabids & butterflies [@jeanneretQuantifyingImpactLandscape2003] -\> we did not include plant species richness in fine-scale explanatory set as it was circular argument with plants -\> is it really ?
- structure & composition woody layer influence dung beetle diversity, and ground & dung beetles community composition [@soderstromPlantsInsectsBirds2001] -\> positive diversity-heterogeneity relationship
- tree cover main underlying gradient of community structure for both dung & ground beetles [@soderstromPlantsInsectsBirds2001] -\> data collected but not included in the analysis due to very low representativity
- ground beetle diversity positively related to proportion of field layer artificially fertilised [@soderstromPlantsInsectsBirds2001]

- significant influence of grazing regime (low intensive sheep, cattle & none) on both plant & ground beetle species composition in calcareous grasslands but concordance distribution not high enough for them to be used as proxy [@lyonsImpactsContrastingConservation2017]

## Cross-scale influence

-   Our result - correlation between fjord and landscape but none with lower scales
-   influence of broad-scale variables smaller if not invisible at small extent and grain [@siefertScaleDependenceVegetationenvironment2012]

### The fjord

- significant influence of precipitation on nitrate & available P and of temperature on available P in Tibetan alpine meadow [@liRotationalGrazingPromotes2020]
- regional effect on plant, arthropod & bird community composition but in the case of drastic differences in grassland types & landscape [@baldiEffectsGrazingBiogeographic2013]
- variance in floristic composition explained by broad-scale (altitude, mean annual temperature, annual precipitation), management (date of mowing) and field scale (pH, flooding frequency, humidity, available P & total N) [@zelnikPlantSpeciesDiversity2013]
- elevation, along with slope angle and solar radiation, significant driver of plant species composition [@klimekPlantSpeciesRichness2007]
- elevation had significant effect on grassland plant community composition [@buzhdyganDirectIndirectEffects2020] -\> but big gradient, from plains to mountains
- elevation as most important determinant of Carabidae community composition in Mediterranean shrublands, but in the context of wide gradient (1st level 0-400 m) [@kaltsasGroundBeetlesRespond2013]
- strong effect of slope on meadows composition compared to pastures, where elevational gradient is substantially smaller [@klimekPlantSpeciesRichness2007]
- precipitation and temperature affect species dominance [@milchunasQuantitativeEffectsGrazing1993], but pondered according to grazing evolutionary history
- can the complexity of the fjord be approached through such a narrow time window & static variables (average temp/precipitation)?

### The landscape

- For the landscape: as we focused on main species for the plant communities and on main families for the beetle assemblages, We probably lack resolution to be able to detect any effect. If present, forest or wetland specialists would not weight much in the pools and probably be part of the rare species -\> low level of replication, low resolution
- Maybe not enough contrast in the landscape to have effects -\> Nordhordland agricultural landscape still mosaic-like, with low intensification patterns
- landscape intensification & homogenisation affected carabid communities towards smaller, more mobile and ubiquitous species [@burelDifferentialResponseSelected2004]
- dung beetle community composition affected by % urban elements & % arable fields, ground beetle only by % urban elements [@soderstromPlantsInsectsBirds2001] -\> two categories not well represented in our case
- @bataryResponsesGrasslandSpecialist2007 percent cover in grassland in landscape more likely to affect beetle diversity & abundance than grazing intensity
- landscape drivers only marginally influential (presence cultivated fields), if not at all (including variability, heterogeneity, pattern & composition) in driving carabid & spider community composition against local habitat drivers such as habitat type (meadows at different intensities, hedgerows, orchards, forest edges) or plant species richness [@jeanneretQuantifyingImpactLandscape2003]
- landscape configuration may be more important compared with diversity & composition and compared with factors strictly related to intensity @schweigerQuantifyingImpactEnvironmental2005
- effect of different elements of landscape on biodiversity @seppeltHarmonizingBiodiversityConservation2016

### Scale issue

@lapierreDriversVariationAboveground2016 - nutrient availability & precipitation period stronger predictor of ANPP than total precipitation + even if dominant grasses drove ANPP responses, relative responses of rare grass & forb to nutrient addition greater

- missing temporal patterns
- animal behaviour impacted by environment & plant community[@brownImportanceScaleEvaluating1989]
- influence of topography on sheep daily grazing time [@hesterForagingBehaviourSheep1999]
- in-field patchiness of vegetation structure with different grazing capacities created by cattle grazing [@gilhausCattleForagingHabits2014]
- difficulty to apprehend interactions across scales and compartments
- small response scale against explanatory scale [@siefertScaleDependenceVegetationenvironment2012]
- only 15-20% variation in species composition plants, butterflies & carabids explained by all three scale heterogeneity (landscape, farm, field) [@weibullSpeciesCompositionAgroecosystems2003]
- still landscape scale should not be overlooked as it may explain more variability than local scale @schweigerQuantifyingImpactEnvironmental2005
- butterfly species richness sensitive to both large-scale & small-scale, while carabids only sensitive to small-scale [@weibullSpeciesRichnessAgroecosystems2003]
- influence of landscape context depends on spatial scale of study, and also interaction influence x spatial scale depends on the guild [@steffan-dewenterScaledependentEffectsLandscape2002]
- Topographical characteristics and soil quality have been shown to be drivers of plant community composition in managed grasslands, but overall variation explained for species composition quite low, especially compared to species diversity [@klimekPlantSpeciesRichness2007]

### Statistical analysis

- First of all, the number of replicates was low for both the scope (cross-scale multivariate) and the type (canonical correlation) of analysis. For example, each livestock type was represented by 9 or 10 fields, which is an insufficient level of replication considering the amount and range of environmental variation within our study area, that we were willing to capture. 

- Canonical analysis -\> works best with high number of replicates as it should require normal distribution of variables.
- responses of communities not as straightforward as for species richness either due to response complexity or statistical analysis [@klimekPlantSpeciesRichness2007]

- Methodological implication -\> different outcomes with cancor and RDA

-   <!-- The statistical power of our analysis being limited by our low replication level (n = 29) and the assumption of linearity of the canonical correlation -->

- limitation using species-based approach only: from savannah example, fodder quality of individual species dependent on rainfall and site productivity, as absence of limiting factors allow plant development towards defensive strategies against herbivores [@hopcraftHerbivoresResourcesRisks2010]

- community-based response not the easiest to detect
- no influence of rotational cattle grazing scheme on overall plant species composition but differences detected when narrowed at the life trait group in sub-alpine & alpine pastures [@perottiYearRotationalGrazing2018]


## Bilan - in Nordhorldand

@rosa-schleichEcologicaleconomicTradeoffsDiversified2019

@gillerFutureFarmingWho2021

- Despite the limitation for reproducibility and comparability of small-scale studies, such context-dependent assessment necessary to accurately identify trade-offs induced by different farming practices and to drive bottom-up approaches for sustainable farming @germanRelationshipsMultipleAspects2017

### Our results

-   Paradoxically, our gradient may be too short for showing effect at very broad scale (fjord gradient), but on the other hand our number of replicates was too small -\> with such low amount of replicates and diversity (lots of noise), only very strong influence would show
-   The productivity potential of individual grazing fields in small-scale farming is dependent from both natural and anthropogenic factors, which can be so deeply intertwined that it is difficult and maybe not always pertinent to treat them independently \[REF\].
-   we considered only the descending direction, while the system is obviously more complex with bottom-up feedback
-   No taxonomic group can be a good surrogate of all the others for assessing effects of landscape and/or land-use in agricultural environment [@billeterIndicatorsBiodiversityAgricultural2007]
-   Importance of including different taxa, because responses differ [@gonthierBiodiversityConservationAgriculture2014]
- *Potentilla erecta* and *Rumex acetosa* highly nutritious for macro-nutrients & micro-nutrients respectively, and also high protein concentration [@marrsReleaseSheepGrazing2020]

### What is good about small scale farming in Western Norway

-   rotational grazing beneficial for both plant diversity and field productivity [@boavistaEffectsGrazingRegimes2019]
-   increase plant species diversity (Shannon), richness & fruit production under late grazing (from mid-July) compared with early (from May) [@lennartssonEffectTimingGrassland2012]
-   aboveground diversity, multidiversity and multifunctionality higher under mixed grazing [@wangDiversifyingLivestockPromotes2019]
- small-scale farming more likely to have sharper shifts along the multifunctionality gradient due to a narrower range of opportunities, while transition has more chance to be more gradual on large capitalised farms [@wilsonWeakStrongMultifunctionality2008]
- Aside of a few core principles underlining the effect of grazing management on plant biomass and species growth, the wide range of inherent and management-driven ecological variation & context make the assessment of grazing effect on grassland assemblages particularly difficult [@briskeRotationalGrazingRangelands2008]
